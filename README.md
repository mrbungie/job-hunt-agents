# claude-job-hunt

Skills that run a job search end to end, honestly.

---

**Start here, and pick the line that describes you.**

**In an app — Claude in your browser or on your desktop.** Install the plugin
and say *"find me some jobs"*. **Nothing else to install.** The board sweeps,
the scoring, the ledger and the documents-as-markdown all work with what is
already there: **every Python script in this plugin uses the standard library
and nothing else.** Two things, and only two, need software on your machine —
**a rendered PDF** and **the boards that need a browser** — and both are
optional. Without them you get markdown files and the boards that answer plain
HTTP, which is most of them, **and the plugin tells you which it skipped**.

**In the Claude Code terminal.** Same thing, plus the shell commands in this
file. If something looks wrong, `bin/doctor.sh` says what is missing and what
it blocks — **it is a diagnostic, not a first step**, and nothing needs to be
green before you begin.

**Either way, your files are plain files in a folder you choose**, and the
plugin says which folder before it writes anything in it.

---

- **`job-scan`** — sweeps the job boards you switch on, in *your own* Chrome,
  scores every ad against your real profile, and keeps a ledger so the same ad
  is never proposed twice. Ships with **JobSpy** as the preferred broad public-
  board source, then mcp-chrome and HiringCafe as documented fallbacks,
  **job-room.ch**, **France Travail**, **Empléate** and the
  **Bundesagentur für Arbeit** (the Swiss, French, Spanish and German public
  employment services — the last of them nearly a million ads, no browser either), **Workday / Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby** (your target
  employers' own boards, plus **SmartRecruiters**) plus **umantis** (the Swiss
  ATS nothing else indexes),
  **LinkedIn**, **jobup.ch**, **jobs.ch** and **Indeed**; no board is
  enabled until you enable it.
- **`cover-letter`** — takes one ad, from **any board**, and produces a
  tailored, ATS-compliant resume and cover letter as markdown and PDF, after
  telling you whether the job is actually worth applying to **and roughly what
  it pays for someone with your record**. Needs no adapter and no browser: a URL
  is enough.
- **`interview-prep`** — the briefing sheet for an interview you have booked,
  built from what the employer actually received, **and the debrief
  afterwards**: what was answered, what was **not**, the next step and its
  date, and your own read of the room. One skill for both, because the useful
  half of a debrief is which of your prepared questions came back unanswered.
- **`linkedin-watch`** — **the openings your network mentions and nobody
  posts on a board.** Reads your LinkedIn feed in your own Chrome and reports
  the leads — *"my team is hiring", a connection resharing an opening* — with
  the scope you choose: posts alone, or posts and their comments. **It writes a
  report of its own and never the ledger**, because a post has no structured
  employer, no location and often no URL, and folding an inferred inventory into
  a measured one would corrupt the coverage counters silently. *It never claims
  the feed is exhausted: the feed is algorithmic, there is no total to compare
  against, and it says how many posts it saw and where it stopped instead.*
- **`linkedin-profile`** — **survey your own LinkedIn profile and show the
  gap.** Reads the profile in your own Chrome, section by section, reads the
  documents in `profile/`, and prints the difference: what is absent, what
  diverges, and what neither source covers. **It writes nothing and asks
  nothing** — the point is to see the gap before anything is changed. *It
  enumerates the fields from the form itself rather than from a list kept here,
  because a list would be right on the day it was written; and it never
  proposes a figure, a scope or a team size you have not stated, because a
  number nobody said has to be defended in the interview.*
- **`interview-rehearsal`** — **sit the interview before you sit it.** The
  agent plays the people across the table, with facets you are not told:
  technical depth, managerial and commercial instinct, warmth or hostility,
  and **the fear of being replaced by you**. They are drawn and sealed before
  the first question, so the debrief afterwards reveals what was actually
  played rather than what would best explain how it went — and it scores you
  against bases it names, never a bare percentage.
- **`job-report`** — how many applications you actually sent over a period,
  which ones reached an interview, and which are still undeclared to an
  unemployment office. Counts what went out, not what you looked at.

The unusual part is what it *refuses* to do: it will not claim a skill you do
not have, will not answer a screening question by guessing, will not report an
application as sent unless it saw the confirmation, and will tell you not to
apply when the fit is poor. A job search runs on your credibility; the tool
treats that as the thing to protect.

**And it never fails silently.** Anything skipped, partial, capped or guessed is
in the output of the run that did it — counted as *n of m*, with the reason and
the fix. A job search is invisible work with delayed feedback; you find out
weeks later, from a silence, that something did not happen. That is the failure
mode this plugin is built against. See
[`shared/never-fail-silently.md`](shared/never-fail-silently.md).

**Python 3.9 or newer, and nothing outside the standard library.** The floor is
measured, not chosen — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The parsing core is tested on
Linux, macOS and Windows on every push: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`.

## What you need

Nothing here is unusual, but **all of it is needed for the full workflow**. The
plugin degrades honestly: without the browser it still writes your documents,
without LaTeX it still writes the markdown. It just tells you what it cannot do
instead of failing halfway.

**You do not have to install this list up front.** Start the plugin and it
checks each tool at the moment it needs one — then names what is missing, says
what it blocks, gives you the exact command for your platform, and offers to run
it. This section is here for anyone who would rather do it in one pass.

| # | Requirement | Needed for | Without it |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | **Claude Code**, recent version | everything | — |
| 2 | **A profile to work from** — a LinkedIn account you can export, or an existing CV | the factual record every document is checked against | The plugin cannot work; it will not invent a career |
| 3 | **Google Chrome** + **[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)** connected in the profile you choose | scanning ads, filling application forms | Documents still work; nothing opens or fills automatically. You give an ad URL, or paste the text |
| 3b | **Being logged in to the board yourself**, in that Chrome — LinkedIn requires it, jobup.ch does not | scanning LinkedIn, Easy Apply | The plugin works *inside* your session and never signs in for you |
| 4 | **`pandoc`** | markdown → PDF | No PDFs. The markdown is still written and you can convert it yourself |
| 5 | **A LaTeX engine with `xelatex`** (TeX Live, MacTeX or MiKTeX) | the PDF layout | Same as above — `render.sh` prints the install command and stops |
| 6 | **The Noto Sans font family** | both PDF templates set it as the main font | `xelatex` aborts with a font error |
| 7 | **`poppler`** — provides `pdftotext` and `pdfinfo` | reading your profile exports, checking page counts | Setup cannot validate your exports, and page-count checks are skipped |
| 8 | **ImageMagick** + **Python 3** with **Pillow** | *optional* — turning a scanned signature into a transparent PNG | No signature image; the letter leaves blank space to sign by hand |
| 9 | **~50 MB of disk** in your home directory | the workspace: your profile, the ledger, one folder per application | — |

**On the browser parts.** They work *inside your own logged-in session*. You log
in yourself, in your own Chrome; the plugin never handles your credentials,
never signs in for you, and never submits anything without asking you first.

## Install — Linux

Tested on Debian/Ubuntu. For Fedora or Arch, substitute your package manager —
the package names are close.

### 1. System packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  pandoc \
  poppler-utils \
  fonts-noto-core \
  texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-xetex
```

Optional, only if you want a handwritten signature on your letters:

```bash
sudo apt install -y imagemagick python3-pil
```

<details>
<summary>Fedora / RHEL</summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install -y pandoc poppler-utils google-noto-sans-fonts \
  texlive-scheme-basic texlive-xetex texlive-collection-fontsrecommended
sudo dnf install -y ImageMagick python3-pillow   # optional
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Arch</summary>

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed pandoc poppler noto-fonts \
  texlive-basic texlive-xetex texlive-fontsrecommended
sudo pacman -S --needed imagemagick python-pillow   # optional
```
</details>

### 2. Chrome and mcp-chrome

1. Install Google Chrome if you do not have it.
2. Install and connect **[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)**.
3. Open the Chrome profile you want to use and grant its site permission for
   your job board (`linkedin.com`).
4. **Log in to the job board in that Chrome**, as yourself. Keep it logged in.

### 3. The client

Install the local clone with the matching command in [Manual installation from
a local clone](#manual-installation-from-a-local-clone). Do not use a
marketplace command.

### 4. Fonts

If `fc-list | grep -i "noto sans"` returns nothing after step 1, install the
family manually from <https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans> into
`~/.local/share/fonts/`, then run `fc-cache -f`.

Then go to [Check that it works](#check-that-it-works).

---

## Install — macOS

### 1. Homebrew

If you do not have it:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the "Next steps" it prints — on Apple Silicon it tells you to add
`/opt/homebrew/bin` to your `PATH`, and nothing works until you do.

### 2. System packages

```bash
brew install pandoc poppler
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui font-noto-sans
```

`mactex-no-gui` is a large download (~2 GB) — it is the full TeX distribution
without the GUI applications. A lighter alternative is BasicTeX plus the
packages the templates need:

```bash
brew install --cask basictex
sudo tlmgr update --self
sudo tlmgr install fontspec xcolor geometry titlesec enumitem parskip
```

Optional, only for a handwritten signature:

```bash
brew install imagemagick
python3 -m pip install --user Pillow
```

### 3. Make `xelatex` findable

MacTeX puts its binaries in `/Library/TeX/texbin` and adds them to the `PATH`
through `/etc/paths.d/TeX`, which **only a fresh login shell picks up**. Open a
new terminal after installing, or:

```bash
eval "$(/usr/libexec/path_helper)"
```

`render.sh` also probes the usual locations itself, so this rarely bites — but
if you see "xelatex not found" straight after installing, this is why.

### 4. Chrome and mcp-chrome

1. Install Google Chrome.
2. Install and connect **[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)**.
3. Open the Chrome profile you want to use and grant its site permission for
   `linkedin.com`.
4. **Log in to LinkedIn in that Chrome**, as yourself.

### 5. The client

Install the local clone with the matching command in [Manual installation from
a local clone](#manual-installation-from-a-local-clone). Do not use a
marketplace command.

Then go to [Check that it works](#check-that-it-works).

---

## Install — Windows

The plugin's helper scripts are `bash` scripts, so Windows needs a bash. There
are two routes; **WSL2 is the one to pick unless you have a reason not to.**

### Route A — WSL2 (recommended)

**1. Install WSL2 with Ubuntu.** In PowerShell, as Administrator:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Reboot when asked, then open **Ubuntu** from the Start menu and create your
Linux user.

**2. Install Claude Code inside WSL**, following the official instructions for
Linux. From here on, run Claude Code from the Ubuntu shell, not PowerShell.

**3. Install the system packages** — the same as
[Install — Linux](#install--linux) step 1, run inside Ubuntu.

**4. Chrome and mcp-chrome stay on Windows.** Install Chrome and
**[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)** in Windows, connect the
profile you intend to use, grant it permission for `linkedin.com`, and log in
there.

> **Caveat worth knowing before you count on it.** Claude Code runs inside WSL
> while Chrome runs on Windows — two different environments. Whether the
> local mcp-chrome endpoint connects across that boundary depends on your
> setup. **Test it first** (see
> [Check that it works](#check-that-it-works), step 4). If it does not connect,
> everything except browser automation still works: you paste the ad text and
> the plugin writes your documents. If browser automation matters to you, use
> Route B.

**5. Where to keep your workspace.** Keep it inside the Linux filesystem
(`~/Documents/job_applications`), not under `/mnt/c/`. Cross-filesystem access
is slow and mangles permissions. To reach your files from Windows Explorer, use
the `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<you>\` path.

### Route B — native Windows

Claude Code runs on Windows directly, and uses **Git Bash** for shell commands.
Everything works provided the tools are on your `PATH`.

**1. Git for Windows** (this is what provides Git Bash):

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
```

**2. The document toolchain:**

```powershell
winget install --id JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc -e
winget install --id MiKTeX.MiKTeX -e
winget install --id oschwartz10612.Poppler -e
```

MiKTeX installs packages on demand the first time a document needs them —
**allow it when it asks**, or the first render fails with a missing-package
error.

Poppler is not always on the `PATH` after install. Check with
`pdftotext -v` in Git Bash; if it is missing, add its `bin` folder to your
`PATH` environment variable and reopen the shell.

**3. The Noto Sans font.** Download
[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans), select all the
`.ttf` files, right-click → **Install for all users**. The PDF templates set it
as the main font and `xelatex` aborts without it.

**4. Optional — signature support:**

```powershell
winget install --id ImageMagick.ImageMagick -e
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 -e
py -m pip install --user Pillow
```

**5. Chrome and mcp-chrome** — install Chrome, install and connect
**[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)** in the chosen profile,
grant it permission for `linkedin.com`, and log in.

**6. The client.** Install the local clone with the matching command in
[Manual installation from a local clone](#manual-installation-from-a-local-clone).
Do not use a marketplace command.

**Known rough edges on native Windows.** Paths with spaces (`C:\Users\Ada
Lovelace\`) occasionally trip shell quoting; if a script fails oddly, that is
the first thing to suspect. The workspace defaults to
`~/Documents/job_applications`, which Git Bash resolves under your Windows user
profile — that is fine.

---

## Updating

Update the clone, then re-run the same client block from [Manual installation
from a local clone](#manual-installation-from-a-local-clone):

```sh
git -C "$REPO" pull --ff-only
```

Restart the client after copying skills: hosts generally discover them at
session start. This project has no published marketplace release or automatic
updater.

## If something looks wrong

**This is a diagnostic and not a step.** Nothing here has to be green before
you start: the plugin degrades on purpose and says what it skipped. Reach for
this when a run tells you something is missing, or when you want to know in
advance what a rendered PDF will cost you.

**One command**, in the shell Claude Code uses (Git Bash on native Windows,
Ubuntu in WSL, your terminal elsewhere):

```bash
bin/doctor.sh
```

**Its output is a data source, not an interface.** `[ ok ]` / `[MISS]` rows and
`install: sudo apt…` lines are precise and unreadable; in an app, ask for it to
be **run and translated** — *"what is missing and does it matter for me?"* —
rather than shown.

It detects your platform, checks every tool, and for anything missing tells you
what it blocks and the exact install command **for that platform**. It changes
nothing and always exits 0 — it is a report, not a gate.

<details>
<summary>The long way, if you would rather check by hand</summary>

Four checks:

```bash
# 1. The document toolchain
pandoc --version | head -1
xelatex --version | head -1
pdftotext -v            # prints to stderr; that is normal

# 2. The font
fc-list 2>/dev/null | grep -i "noto sans" | head -3
#   macOS without fontconfig: ls ~/Library/Fonts /Library/Fonts | grep -i noto
#   Windows: check the Fonts control panel for "Noto Sans"

# 3. The workspace location the plugin will use
echo "${JOB_HUNT_HOME:-$HOME/Documents/job_applications}"
```

**4. The browser.** In Claude Code, ask: *"open a tab on linkedin.com and tell
me whether I'm logged in."* You should get an answer about the page. If Claude
reports no connected browser, the extension is not installed, not signed in, or
has no permission for that site.

</details>

Any of these can fail and you can still use the plugin — you will just be told
what is unavailable, and offered the manual route.

## Platform support

**The whole plugin is written to run identically on Windows, macOS and Linux.**
There is one implementation — portable `bash` — because Claude Code runs shell
commands through Git Bash on Windows, and duplicating the safety-critical logic
into PowerShell would create a second version that drifts. The reasoning, and
the platform traps that were handled, are in
[`shared/portability.md`](shared/portability.md).

What that means in practice, stated honestly:

| Platform | Status |
| :-- | :-- |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | **Verified** — scripts, PDF rendering, signature keying and both board adapters run end to end |
| **Linux / WSL2** | Written for it, **not yet run by the author**. Standard shell, packages named above |
| **Windows** (Git Bash) | Written for it, **not yet run by the author**. The specific traps — no `python3`, no `file`, no `fc-list`, OneDrive-redirected folders, `start` instead of `open` — are all handled deliberately |

`bin/doctor.sh` is there so you can settle it in five seconds rather than trust
the table. **If something is broken on your platform, that is a bug worth an
issue** — it is meant to work, and a report is the fastest way there.

One Windows note worth acting on before you start: if OneDrive Backup is on,
your real Documents folder is under `$HOME/OneDrive/Documents`, so pin the
workspace explicitly and avoid hunting for files later — **in your shell
profile, not in a one-off command**:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or the PowerShell profile
export JOB_HUNT_HOME="$HOME/OneDrive/Documents/job_applications"
```

**Where you put that line is the whole instruction, not a detail.** Typed at a
prompt it lasts as long as that shell, and an assistant driving this plugin
gets a fresh shell per command — measured 2026-09-05: two consecutive tool
calls ran as PID 30257 and PID 30444, and a variable exported in the first was
empty in the second. The profile *is* read, so the line above works from there
and only from there.

`doctor.sh` detects that case and tells you.

---

## First run

Just use it. The first invocation of either skill notices there is no
configuration and walks you through setup — about five minutes. **Every
question comes with the exact URL or command that produces the answer**, and
anything that does not look right comes back with the reason and the fix
rather than a shrug.

**Your profile is read from your own browser, in your own session — no printing
to PDF.** That used to be five hand-printed files and it was where people
stopped: the print dialog is a wall no automation crosses, and a page you had
not scrolled to the bottom printed a valid, incomplete file **with no error at
all**. Only the text was ever used. So the text is what is taken now, and the
five PDFs remain as a fallback for anyone who prefers them.

```
/job-scan                        # sweep the boards you enabled, fill the ledger
/cover-letter <job ad URL>       # one ad from any board, start to finish
/cover-letter                    # takes the best pending ad from the ledger
/job-setup                       # change any of it, later
/job-setup orientation           # what you're looking for changed — re-picks the boards
/job-setup boards                # enable or configure a board
/board-request <board URL>       # note a board that has no adapter yet
/interview-prep <company>        # briefing sheet for a booked interview
/interview-prep                  # …or the debrief, after the meeting
/interview-rehearsal             # rehearse one, from your profile alone
/interview-rehearsal <company>   # …or from the application in your ledger
/linkedin-profile                # survey your LinkedIn and show what's missing
/linkedin-watch                  # leads hiding in your network's posts
/job-report                      # applications sent this month
/job-report --interviews         # the ones that reached a meeting
/job-report --from 2026-07-01 --to 2026-07-31
```

You will be asked for, in this order: your profile documents, your contact
details (pre-filled from those documents — you confirm rather than type), your
home base and how far you will commute, your working languages, **what you are
actually looking for**, the searches to run, how selective to be, and which
optional modules you want.

That middle step is the one that does the most work. The plugin reads your
documents, shows you back the profile it derived — trade, seniority, sectors,
base, contract types — and asks you to correct it. Then four questions:
**continuity, a wider net, or a career change? stay local, move within the
country, or relocate? which countries? which kinds of contract?** Your answers
decide how the search queries are written and **which boards get switched on**
— you are proposed three or four with a reason each, and told which were left
out and why, instead of picking from a list of twenty.

Your CV says what you have done; it does not say what you want next. Nothing
here assumes the two are the same. When that changes — you widen the geography,
you decide to change trade — `/job-setup orientation` re-runs just that step
and re-picks the boards, keeping every board's existing settings.

---

## What it creates

Everything lives in **your workspace**, outside the plugin, so updating or
removing the plugin never touches your data:

```
~/Documents/job_applications/        # or wherever $JOB_HUNT_HOME points
├── config.yml                       # settings
├── candidate.md                     # your identity, target roles, hard blockers
├── commute.md                       # travel times you validated (optional)
├── repos.md                         # what your own code proves (optional)
├── signature.png                    # optional
├── profile/                         # your LinkedIn exports or CV
├── job-pipeline.md                  # the ledger — every ad, once
└── 20260826_Acme-Senior-Engineer/   # one folder per application
    ├── job-ad.md
    ├── resume.md  →  Lovelace_Ada_Acme.pdf
    └── cover-letter.md  →  Lovelace_Ada_Acme_CoverLetter.pdf
```

Plain files. Read them, grep them, back them up, delete them.

**One of them is generated rather than written: `config.yml`.** Say what
changed — *"I've moved"*, *"add that board"* — and it is edited for you, one
thing at a time. Hand-editing works and is the fallback; some of its
distinctions bite quietly (an empty list is not a missing key), which is why
it is not the announced route.

## Job boards

| Board | Sweep | Login to scan | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Workday** | yes, per employer | no | Where the large Swiss employers are — Swisscom, Swiss Life, Roche, Lindt. **No browser.** Applying still means creating an account on their site yourself; the plugin never does that |
| **umantis** | yes, per employer | no | Haufe/Abacus umantis — Swiss SMEs, communes, clinics and institutes. **No browser.** The one board here that reaches employers **no other sweep indexes at all**; you give it the employer's careers URL, because no tenant directory exists |
| **Solique** | yes, per employer | no | Swiss portals — ISS, Kanton Zürich, Manor, Otto's. **No browser.** Some tenants serve their whole board as JSON, others a truncated HTML page; you are always told which, and how much of the board you got |
| **SAP SuccessFactors** | yes, per employer | no | Where Rolex, BCV and much of Romandie's large employers publish. **No browser**, despite a careers page that renders nothing without one. Give it the employer's careers domain |
| **SmartRecruiters** | yes, per employer | no | Same family, public JSON, **no browser**. Separate `remote` and `hybrid` flags, and a server-side country filter. A wrong tenant answers `200` with zero postings, so an empty result is never proof they are not hiring |
| **La Bonne Alternance** | yes | no, but **a free key** | The state's apprenticeship service. **No browser**; the key is free and self-service at api.apprentissage.beta.gouv.fr and takes three minutes. Alongside posted ads it returns **companies that take apprentices without advertising at all** — 150 in the Rhône — which nothing else here does. Alternance only |
| **Emploi Territorial** | yes | no | The jobs of French **local government** — communes, departments, regions, social-action centres. 26 613 posts that no private board carries, and with the state portal already covered, the other half of the French public sector. **No browser, no account, no key.** Its ads carry a **real application deadline**, which most boards do not |
| **Cegid Talentsoft** | yes, per employer | no | The careers system of French ministries, airports, energy groups and large agencies — **including `choisirleservicepublic.gouv.fr`**, the state's own portal, which is a Talentsoft tenant and needs no separate board (51 708 open posts) — the last of the five French ATS this plugin reads. **No browser, no account, no key.** Its listings carry the **street address and the posting date without opening the ad**, which almost nothing else does |
| **DigitalRecruiters** | yes, per employer | no | The ATS behind French retail and franchise careers sites — Monoprix's alone had 948 open roles. **No browser, no account, no key.** Its sites sit on the employer's own domain, so you give it that hostname. Its ads carry a **full street address**, which almost nothing else does — but reading them is paced at the 10 seconds the site asks for, so the sweep screens first and reads what passes |
| **Softy** | yes, per employer | no, but **your own Chrome** | The third ATS of French SMEs. It runs in your browser and that is deliberate, not a limitation: its robots.txt welcomes everyone and then names the AI crawlers to refuse them, so the sweep goes through your own session instead of pretending the rule does not apply. Watch the locations — an ad can cover seven towns and only shows the first |
| **Flatchr** | yes, per employer | no | The other ATS of French SMEs and mid-sized companies. **No browser, no account, no key**, and **one request per employer is the entire sweep** — the ad texts, the salary with its period, the ROME code and even the screening questions come back with the list. Like Taleez there is no directory, so you give it the careers URL |
| **Taleez** | yes, per employer | no | The ATS of French SMEs and mid-sized companies — the employers no meta-board indexes at all. **No browser, no account, no key**: one request returns an employer's entire careers site, and one of the six sampled held 412 open roles. Like umantis there is **no directory**, so you give it the careers URL; unlike an agency board, the employer named *is* the workplace |
| **Greenhouse**, **Lever**, **Ashby** | yes, per employer | no | Your target employers' own job boards, read straight from their ATS. **No browser.** They tell you whether *a named employer* is hiring — for *who is hiring near me*, that is HiringCafe and job-room |
| **France Travail** | yes | **a free account**, not a login | France's public employment service, ex-Pôle emploi — 13 295 live offers in Paris alone. **No browser.** The only board here that needs an API key. Getting one is **free and takes about three minutes**: an account on francetravail.io, an application, and a subscription to *Offres d'emploi v2*. It is a developer account — **not** a France Travail *candidate* account, not linked to your jobseeker file, and creating one tells nobody you are looking. `/job-setup` walks you through every click. Sweeps its own ads *and* the partner boards feeding it — a search that does not ask for both silently returns a quarter of the board and looks complete doing it |
| **job-room.ch** | yes | no | Switzerland's public employment service portal (SECO), through its public API. **No browser needed.** Reaches the Swiss SMEs and foundations the others miss — and tells you exactly which jobup row each of its duplicates is |
| **HiringCafe** | yes | no | Worldwide meta-board over ~40 ATS: every ad is an employer posting, linked to that employer's own application page. **Needs no browser and no extension.** Blind to the Swiss ATS (Refline, Ostendis, Umantis), and thin in emerging markets |
| **LinkedIn** | yes | **yes**, in your own Chrome | Also drives Easy Apply forms — you always validate the send |
| **randstad.ch** | yes | no | The staffing agency's Swiss board — around 985 ads. **No browser.** Its structured data is missing on the Romandie ads, so the adapter reads them the same way regardless |
| **persigo.ch** | yes | no | A Swiss staffing agency, central Switzerland. **No browser**, whole board in one request. Ads stay listed a long time — some over a year — and the listing carries no date, so freshness costs one request per ad |
| **sozialinfo.ch** | yes | no | Switzerland's social-sector portal — social work, care, education, cantonal services, foundations. **No browser**, and the whole board arrives in one request. Alone among these boards it **names the employer** and links to their site, and every ad carries a postcode |
| **fachkraft.ch** | yes | no | Swiss trades and industry, through a staffing agency. **No browser**, and the whole board — around 3 500 ads — arrives in one request. It is the umbrella for sta.jobs and stellenpartner.ch, so sweep it alone. The employer is **never named**, as on any agency board |
| **Michael Page** | yes | no | The recruitment agency's own board, country-scoped. **No browser.** Reaches roles that never appear on an employer's ATS — but the employer is **described, never named**, so you cannot research them before applying |
| **Cadremploi** | yes, 30 ads per page | no, but **your own Chrome** | The other French cadre board. It blocks scripted access outright, so this one runs in your browser like LinkedIn does — no login needed to scan, and if a challenge ever appears you solve it, never the plugin. Worth knowing: its location filter has a decoy parameter that is accepted and silently ignored, and its results drift out of your area further down the page, so the sweep filters on the town you asked for |
| **Figaro Emploi** (ex-Keljob) | yes, 30 ads per page | no, but **your own Chrome** | Big French generalist — 244 815 ads in its own sitemap. **This is where Keljob went**: keljob.com now redirects here, and its retired paths answer 410 Gone. Cloudflare blocks scripts, so it runs in your browser like Cadremploi. It browses by department, town and trade — never the search page, which the site's robots.txt closes twice over. About a third of its ads state a salary, and the ad count it announces is the count it actually serves, which is rarer than it should be |
| **Jobology** — 9 boards sectoriels | yes, 20 ads per page | no | One adapter, **nine French sector boards**: distribution (Distrijob 22 361), santé (Jobvitae 17 950), transport (Jobtransport 15 654), tourisme, énergie, maritime, sport, environnement, supply chain — **72 667 ads**. The work the generalists cover worst: driving, warehouse, retail floor, care, kitchens, ships. No browser, no account. Ads are the platform's own, not a France Travail rerun, and the postcode is on every one. Two warnings: past the last page it keeps serving plausible ads forever, and two thirds of the named employers are staffing agencies |
| **Batiactu** | yes, 20 ads per page | no | French **construction and public works** — 9 984 ads, the biggest sector the plugin had no coverage for. No browser, no account. **Coordinates on every ad**, which no other board here gives. Two warnings worth reading before you trust a result: the region filter matches the *employer's name*, so a third of the Île-de-France page is elsewhere in France (the adapter re-filters on the postcode), and the street address is the company's head office, not the job site |
| **ANEFA** | yes, 20 ads per page | no | French **farm work** — 2 818 ads of harvests, vineyards, livestock and market gardening, gathered nowhere else. No browser, no account, and the site declares no robots.txt at all. It answers what seasonal work actually turns on: **is there a bed, is there a meal** — on every single ad — plus the certificates a farm asks for. Two things to know: it names no employer (the farm is described, not named), and its department parameter is an internal ordinal that drifts past Corsica, so asking for 29 quietly returns the Eure-et-Loir |
| **Welcome to the Jungle** | yes — 88 222 ads in its sitemaps | no, but **your own Chrome** for reading | The biggest French inventory left: startups and scale-ups, but also Carrefour, Thales, Vinci and the Ministère des Armées. **Cut in two**: finding the ads needs no browser (the site publishes a sitemap and the `lastmod` is real, per ad, so a re-scan only reads what changed), but every page answers an AWS WAF challenge as **HTTP 202** — a success status with no ad in it — so reading them runs in your browser, one page at a time. It is the only board here that gives you **the employer's own website** alongside the ad. Careful with `/fr/`: it is a language, not a country |
| **Adecco France** | yes, 13 293 ads | no | The biggest interim network here — production, logistics, maintenance, building trades, driving. **No browser, no account.** Its sitemap names its country in the file name, and a salary is on two ads in three. But the employer is always **adecco**: the client is described in the body and never named, so there is no company to research and no key to match against its own ATS. Careful with the URL — the department in it is truncated, and `loire` ends 1 065 ads across six different departments |
| **Randstad France** | yes, 6 755 ads | no | The second interim network, and the better-built one: a **postcode on every ad**, a town in the URL you can trust, `EUR` where Adecco writes `"France "`, and no invented expiry date. Half Adecco's volume and cleaner throughout. Same one caveat: the employer is **Randstad France** on every ad, so the client is described and never named. Not the same site as `randstad.ch` |
| **Crit** | yes, 16 175 ads | no | The **largest French interim board here** — bigger than Adecco. Two things it does better than any French board in the repo: **a real salary range in euros on every ad** (a minimum *and* a maximum, where the others leave the maximum at zero), and **a genuine per-ad date** — 13 893 distinct timestamps in 16 175, so a re-scan only reads what changed. Its URLs are UUIDs, so that date is also the only free way to narrow. The employer is the **local branch** — CRIT LUNEL, CRIT ARRAS BTP — which is more than Adecco tells you, but still not the client |
| **Hays France** | yes, 3 193 ads | no | A **specialist recruiter**, not an interim network: finance, audit, IT, engineering, construction management — a different population from the other agency boards. Descriptions run to ~2 000 characters and the sector is real. But it is the thinnest of the five: **no postcode at all** (the field holds the string `NA`), a salary figure only one time in four, and a location field that is a town, a department or a region depending on the ad. Its sitemap wraps every URL in **CDATA** — the single most useful thing this board taught |
| **Empléate (SEPE)** | yes, 28 099 ads | no | **Spain's public employment service** — the first Spanish board here, alongside France Travail and job-room.ch. **No browser, no account, no key**, and the cheapest board in the plugin: one request returns a hundred complete ads, full text included, so there is nothing to open. Salary on one ad in five, real per-ad dates, and geography that costs nothing to narrow. Two things to know before you enable it. **Three ads in ten were posted over a year ago** — the oldest in 2020 — and the ad itself does not say so, which is why the adapter reports the age of everything it returns and why you should give it a date. And **the employer is named on only 29% of ads**: on the regional-employment-office feed, the largest of the thirteen it aggregates, you apply through an address written inside the description |
| **Oposiciones (Empléate)** | yes, 1 558 live | no | **Spanish public-sector recruitment** — oposiciones, bolsas de trabajo, convocatorias — from the same host's second index. **No browser, no account, no key.** The hiring body is named on every record, the civil-service group is real, and the application deadline is the field the whole board turns on. Which is the problem: **its own "deadline status" reads *Abierto* on all 76 050 records ever published**, including 498 live ones that closed weeks ago, so the adapter computes the date and hides expired announcements unless you ask for them. Two more things to know. **It is Catalan in practice** — 1 334 of the 1 558 live records come from the Diputació de Barcelona's register, and Madrid has 42. And **there is no ad text**, median 118 characters, so `cover-letter` cannot write from it: an oposición is answered with a form and a documented dossier, and the notice itself is on the source site |
| **Platsbanken** | yes, 39 865 ads | no | **Sweden's public employment service** (Arbetsförmedlingen), through the state's own open-data API — the sixth national public service here and the first Swedish board. **No browser, no account, and no key at all.** It carries the **richest record of any board in the plugin**: full description, an application deadline on every single ad, coordinates, a postcode on most, a three-level occupation taxonomy, and the employer's **legal registration number** — an identifier no other board publishes, and the dedup key that actually crosses between sources. Two things to know. **One query reaches 2 100 ads out of 39 865**, so a city alone overflows and a city plus a date window fits; unlike the German board it says so with an error rather than quietly handing you a slice. And the salary field states **how** the job pays on every ad and **how much** on none |
| **JobsIreland** | yes, 4 934 ads | no | **Ireland's public employment service**, run by the Department of Social Protection — the fifth national public service here and the first Irish board. **No browser, no account, no key**; its `robots.txt` has no `Disallow` line at all. Every ad carries a real **Eircode** and a closing date. **The thing to know before enabling it**: more than half of what it publishes is **not a job** — 135 of the 250 newest ads are Community Employment Scheme placements, a state work-placement scheme entered through an Intreo office rather than by applying to an employer. Nothing on the ad says so in words, so the adapter labels every card and prints the split; ask it for `kind: job` to get ordinary vacancies only. No salary and no description on the listing |
| **Bundesagentur für Arbeit** | yes, 994 348 ads | no | **Germany's federal employment service** — the first German board here, the fourth national public service after France Travail, job-room.ch and Empléate, and **thirty-five times the largest board this plugin had**. **No browser, no account**: the key is printed in the German state's own API specification on `bund.dev`. It names the employer on every ad, gives a real postcode on 192 of 200, and is **the only board here that tells you outright whether the job is temp-agency work** — German law makes the employer declare it, so you are not left inferring it from a company name. It also flags ads open to career changers. **The thing to know before enabling it**: the API returns at most **10 000 ads per query** while reporting the true match count, so a search for Berlin says *45 901* and hands over 10 000. The adapter refuses such a query rather than quietly reading a fifth of it — pair a city with a recency window (`seit: 7`) and it fits. Salary figures are usually an **hourly** rate, and about one ad in ten is an apprenticeship rather than a job |
| **Infoempleo** | yes, 7 621 ads | no | Spain's **generalist private board**, and the first Spanish source here that is not a public register. **No browser, no account, no key.** Descriptions run to ~1 300 characters, the province is on nearly every ad, and `validThrough` is real — so an ad posted a year ago that is still listed is a long-running vacancy, not a corpse. Two things to weigh before enabling it. **The employer is named on every ad, which flatters it**: 32 of 44 are staffing agencies and 60 ads carried only 23 distinct employers, so the name is usually the intermediary and the actual workplace is described without being named. And there is **no postcode on any ad**, with a salary on one in five |
| **APEC** | yes, the whole board | no | France's agency for **management and senior roles** — 77 023 ads. **No browser, no account, no key**, and the only French board here you can page through end to end. It carries a **salary on every ad**, which nothing else does. What it will not give you is the ad text: the listing carries a 283-character teaser and the full description is behind a captcha, so it is excellent for finding roles and you will read the ad on the site |
| **HelloWork** | yes, 20 ads per facet | no | France's largest private generalist board — ex-RegionsJob, where the SMEs and the regions publish. **No browser, no account.** Its robots.txt closes search entirely, so the sweep runs on the site's own sector/town/job-title landing pages: **coverage is the list of facets you configure**, and the plugin enumerates the real ones for you. Its ads carry skills as a list, experience in months and a remote flag — the most structured data of any board here |
| **Meteojob** | yes, 20 ads per search | no | A French generalist board. **No browser, no account.** Its robots.txt allows one search path and puts pagination behind a door marked closed, so a search returns **20 ads and no second page** — several narrow searches, not one broad sweep. Worth it because it names the employer on every ad, which its France Travail feed does not |
| **jobup.ch** | yes | no | French-speaking Switzerland. Ads carry a full street address, which few boards do |
| **jobs.ch** | yes | no | The same platform as jobup, German-speaking Switzerland — and **the same ad ids**, so running both never doubles a row. Three times the national volume; in Romandie jobup still finds more, so it is a companion, not a replacement |
| **Indeed** | yes | possibly | Country-scoped (`ch.indeed.com`, …). **Serves anti-bot challenges** — you solve them, the plugin never does. Ads carry a postcode |
| Anything else | not yet | — | `cover-letter <URL>` still does the whole job |

**No board is enabled until you enable it.** Scanning drives your own browser
under your own account, so it never touches a site you did not switch on. Turn
one on with `/job-setup boards`.

### A board that comes back empty can be parked instead of dropped

Some boards will return nothing for you, and there are two very different
reasons for that. A social-sector portal has nothing for a backend engineer this
month or any other. But a board can also be right for you and simply have had a
quiet week — the run that first swept BOBST's careers site found ten vacancies,
all of them apprenticeships, at an employer twenty-five minutes from the user's
home.

Both look like the same zero, so switching both off the same way throws the
second one away for good. Instead, `job-scan` offers to make a board
**dormant**: it stops sweeping it, keeps its configuration, records the counts
that justified it, and **comes back to you once with a fresh count** — after
three months, then six, then yearly:

> **umantis** (dormant since 2026-08-30) — parked because the 10 vacancies on
> `jobs.bobst.com` were all apprenticeships. Today: 14 vacancies, **3 engineering
> roles**, one *Software Engineer Full Stack* at Mex. Wake it up?

Waking it is one line — its tenants and settings were never deleted. And a board
you switch off outright stays off: **`enabled: false` on its own is silent
forever**, and only a board carrying `dormant_since` is ever brought up again.

**Using a board that has no adapter changes nothing for you** — hand
`cover-letter` the ad URL and it scores the fit and writes both documents as
usual. The only thing you lose is the automatic sweep. When you do that, the
plugin notes what an adapter for that board would need; the report is saved in
your workspace, and it is yours to post as an issue if you want it built.

## Configuration

`config.yml` holds the machine-readable settings — see
[`templates/config.example.yml`](templates/config.example.yml), which documents
every key. `candidate.md` holds the prose the config cannot: your target role
families, the blockers you do not want re-litigated every week, and corrections
that override a stale export.

Edit either by hand, or run `/job-setup` to change one section conversationally.

To put the workspace somewhere else, set `JOB_HUNT_HOME` in your shell profile:

```bash
export JOB_HUNT_HOME="$HOME/work/job-search"
```

---

## Privacy

**Nothing is uploaded anywhere by this plugin.** Your profile, your contact
details and your applications stay in your workspace on your machine. The
browser automation acts in your own Chrome session; the job board sees you, as
usual, and no third party is involved.

There is exactly **one** thing that can ever leave your machine, and only if you
ask for it: a **board request** — a short report saying that some job board has
no adapter yet and what one would need. It is written to your workspace first,
shown to you in full, and submitted as a GitHub issue **under your own account**
only after you say yes. It contains the board's URL, one example ad URL, and
notes on the site's structure — no part of your profile, name or application.
The example ad URL is the one detail that says something about you, so the
plugin offers to strip it before submitting.

What Claude reads, it reads to write your documents — the same way it reads any
file you point it at. If that matters for a particular document, keep it out of
`profile/`.

**Never commit your workspace to a public repository.** It contains your
address, your phone number and your employment history. This repo's
`.gitignore` refuses those filenames as a safety net, but the workspace lives
outside the repo precisely so the question does not arise.

---

## Optional modules

Country-specific add-ons, off by default, in `shared/modules/`:

- **`job-room-ch`** — Switzerland: captures the fields the ORP's *preuve de
  recherche d'emploi* form on job-room.ch requires, while the ad is still open,
  and can help fill the form in your own logged-in session. **It saves entries
  into the open period and then tells you the period's deadline; transmitting
  the period to the ORP stays yours, always.** Saving a row and declaring a
  period are two different acts, and job-room itself separates them.

Modules that touch an official declaration carry an explicit notice:
**they assist, they do not replace your own check.** You are solely responsible
for anything you submit — read every field before you send it. Nothing here is
legal or administrative advice.

Adding a module for your country is the most useful contribution you can make.

## Manual installation from a local clone

This project is **not published in a marketplace**. Each supported client
installs directly from this clone using its native skills/plugin location; do
not call a marketplace command. The commands below are mechanical: they do not
require guessing a source path or merging configuration by hand.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrbungie/job-hunt-agents.git
cd job-hunt-agents
REPO="$PWD"
```

### Required once: mcp-chrome

All browser work uses [mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome).

1. **Install the Chrome extension**:
   - Download the extension build from [hangwin/mcp-chrome releases](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/releases).
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select the extension folder.
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome and click **Connect**.

2. **Install and register the native bridge**:

```sh
node --version                    # Node.js 20+ required
npm install -g mcp-chrome-bridge
mcp-chrome-bridge register
```

The bridge registration configures Chrome Native Messaging (`com.chromemcp.nativehost.json`) so the extension can communicate with local MCP clients.

Before browser work, the plugin asks **“Which
Chrome profile should I use?”** It must not select a profile, sign in, solve
CAPTCHA, approve permissions or 2FA, upload a file, or submit an application.

### Claude Code

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills"
cp -R "$REPO/skills/." "$HOME/.claude/skills/"
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http mcp-chrome http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp
```

### Codex

```sh
CODEX_SKILLS="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
mkdir -p "$CODEX_SKILLS"
cp -R "$REPO/skills/." "$CODEX_SKILLS/"
codex mcp add mcp-chrome --url http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp
```

### Antigravity CLI (Agy)

```sh
agy plugin install "$REPO/adapters/antigravity/plugin"

# Recommended: stdio (CLI) mode — Antigravity manages the MCP process directly:
BRIDGE_PATH="$(npm root -g)/mcp-chrome-bridge/dist/mcp/mcp-server-stdio.js"
agy mcp add mcp-chrome node "$BRIDGE_PATH"

# Alternative: HTTP transport
# agy mcp add mcp-chrome http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp
```

The plugin also carries `mcp_config.json`; the explicit `agy mcp add` makes the
server available even when a host does not import plugin MCP settings.

### OpenCode

`PROJECT` is the existing project where OpenCode will run:

```sh
PROJECT=/absolute/path/to/project
mkdir -p "$PROJECT/.opencode"
cp -R "$REPO/adapters/opencode/skills" "$PROJECT/.opencode/"
(cd "$PROJECT" && opencode mcp add mcp-chrome --url http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp)
```

If that OpenCode version lacks `mcp add --url`, use the tracked
[`adapters/opencode/opencode.json`](adapters/opencode/opencode.json) as a
configuration fragment, adding only its `mcp-chrome` entry. OpenCode discovers
skills under `.opencode/skills/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| A copied skill does not reflect the clone | The client has an older copy | Run `git -C "$REPO" pull --ff-only`, repeat its installation block, then restart the client |
| A new skill is installed but not offered | The skill list is read at session start | Restart Claude Code |
| `ERROR: pandoc not found` / `xelatex not found` | Not installed, or not on the `PATH` of the shell Claude Code uses | Reinstall per your platform above, then open a **new** terminal. On macOS see [Make `xelatex` findable](#3-make-xelatex-findable) |
| `xelatex` aborts on a font error | Noto Sans missing | Install the family, then `fc-cache -f` on Linux |
| MiKTeX asks to install a package mid-render | Normal on first use | Allow it; it happens once |
| "No connected browser" | mcp-chrome is not connected in the selected profile, or the site lacks permission | Connect mcp-chrome in that profile and grant permission for `linkedin.com` |
| The scan says LinkedIn is showing the signed-out page | You are not logged in **in that Chrome** | Log in yourself, then tell Claude to continue. It will not sign in for you |
| The scan only ever sees ~7 ads per search | Expected — the results list is virtualized and the automated tab is hidden | Run more, narrower searches. See [`shared/boards/linkedin.md`](shared/boards/linkedin.md) |
| `sync-sources.sh` reports "missing" for files you exported | They landed somewhere other than Downloads or the Desktop | Move them there, or set `JOB_HUNT_DOWNLOADS` / `JOB_HUNT_DESKTOP` |
| An export has "no selectable text" | It was saved as an image, or via *Save page as* instead of *Print → Save as PDF* | Re-print it — or skip the PDF entirely and let the page be read in your browser, which is now the nominal route |
| A resume is missing jobs | The detail page was printed before it finished loading | Scroll the LinkedIn page to the bottom, re-print, re-run `sync-sources.sh` |
| PDFs are huge | An oversized signature image, not the text | Resize `signature.png`. **Never** compress the PDF with Ghostscript — it silently corrupts the extracted text an ATS reads |

---

## Contributing

**A new board adapter is the most useful contribution.** The contract is in
[`shared/boards/README.md`](shared/boards/README.md), and `linkedin.md` /
`jobup.md` are the worked examples. One rule above all: **document only what you
ran against the live site, and date it.** An adapter describing a plausible DOM
is worse than no adapter — it fails silently, and the user has no way to tell.

**Re-verifying an existing adapter is the second most useful.** Boards change,
and a dated note is what lets the next person tell a broken adapter from a
broken assumption:

```bash
bin/adapter-age.sh          # what is due, oldest claim first (default 30 days)
```

It changes nothing and always exits 0 — a stale adapter is not a broken one, it
is one nobody has re-run. And re-verifying means *running* it against the live
site, never re-reading it: every defect found in a single day of re-verification
was a rule generalised one step past what had been observed, and none were
visible on the page.

**All three platforms are in scope for every change.** One portable `bash`
implementation, no PowerShell fork — the reasoning and the traps are in
[`shared/portability.md`](shared/portability.md). No new dependency lands
without its Windows, macOS and Linux install commands.

Before pushing, validate the manifests — it takes a second and catches a
malformed plugin before anyone installs it:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

**Bump the version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for anything users should
receive.** The plugin cache is keyed by version: merged commits without a bump
are invisible to `/plugin update`, however many there are.

Issues and pull requests welcome. Two rules:

1. **No personal data in a commit**, ever — not yours, not an example person's
   real details. The `templates/*.example.*` files describe a fictional person;
   keep it that way.
2. **Do not add a shortcut that guesses.** Most of the value in these skills is
   the refusals: unopened descriptions marked provisional, unanswerable
   questions left blank, unconfirmed sends never recorded as sent. A change
   that makes the tool smoother by making it less honest will be declined.
