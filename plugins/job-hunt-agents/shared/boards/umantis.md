**No tenant directory was found. Searched 2026-09-02:**

| Looked at | Answer |
| :-- | :-- |
| `recruitingapp-2698.umantis.com/robots.txt` | **200** `text/plain`, 508 bytes — admin paths only, nothing that indexes tenants |
| `recruitingapp-2698.umantis.com/sitemap.xml` | **404** |
| `www.umantis.com/robots.txt` | 200, 112 bytes |
| `umantis.com/sitemap.xml` | 200 `application/xml` — a **WordPress** sitemap index for the vendor's marketing site: posts, pages, case studies, taxonomies. No career hosts |

**And one route deliberately not taken.** Hosts are numbered —
`recruitingapp-<n>.umantis.com` — so the numbering could be walked. That is a
scan of somebody's estate rather than reading a directory, and this adapter
does not do it. Ask the user for the careers URL.

*(`solique.md` carried the same "no directory" sentence until the same day,
when the directory turned out to be at the standard path. This one was looked
for and not found, which is a different statement.)*

**An ATS, not a board**, in the same family as Workday, Greenhouse, Lever and
Ashby: one employer per tenant, no search across employers. It earns an adapter
for the reason those did — it answers *"is my target employer hiring?"* — and it
matters in Switzerland for a reason they do not: **HiringCafe indexes none of
it.** Zero of 771 Swiss ads came from umantis (`hiringcafe.md`), so the SMEs,
communes, clinics and institutes that run on it are invisible to every sweep
that ships today.

> **The HiringCafe measurement behind this is no longer reproducible.** Taken
> 2026-09-03; since 2026-09-05 the licit route answers zero — re-measured
> 2026-09-07 and unchanged, so a settled posture and not an intermittence
> (`shared/boards/hiringcafe.md`). *The figure stands and so does the
> conclusion; what is gone is the ability to take it again.*

> **And a zero of indexation is not a property of this board: it is the state of

> simply believed — it carries no visible margin, and nothing in its shape says
> it was measured rather than observed.*

Read by `skills/job-scan/scripts/umantis.py`. Public HTML, **no key, no cookie,
no browser** — except on the tenants noted in trap 3.

**Verified 2026-08-28** against three live tenants: BOBST (`jobs.bobst.com`,
10 vacancies), Swiss TPH (`recruitingapp-2698.umantis.com`, 2) and Kanton
St. Gallen (`recruitingapp-2800.umantis.com`).

## The two paths, and the SSO that does not matter

```
https://<host>/Jobs                                  the listing
https://<host>/Vacancies/<id>/Description/<segment>  one vacancy, full text
```

`<host>` is either `recruitingapp-<n>.umantis.com` or a vanity domain the
employer owns (`jobs.bobst.com`). **The host tells you nothing; the path tells
you everything.**

**The site root is often gated by SAML SSO — and that is irrelevant.** BOBST's
root 302s to `sso.umantis.com`, while `/Jobs` and every vacancy under it answer
`200` unauthenticated, with the complete description: 1 274 to 5 950 characters
of text across the five vacancies measured.

## The trap that governs the whole adapter

**The trailing segment is per *vacancy*, not per tenant, and it must never be
guessed.** Measured on BOBST, one tenant, four vacancies:

| Vacancy | `/1` | `/2` | `/3` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 9151 | shell | **the job** | shell |
| 9220 | shell | shell | **the job** |
| 9221 | shell | shell | **the job** |
| 9222 | shell | shell | **the job** |

Swiss TPH serves its vacancies at `/1`, and answers with the shell at `/2`.
**Every one of those wrong segments returns HTTP `200`.** Nothing in the status
code says you asked wrongly.

**The discriminator is the `<title>`, and specifically what precedes the
separator:**

| `<title>` | Reading |
| :-- | :-- |
| `Apprenti employé-e de commerce CFC` | the vacancy |
| `  \| Applicant Management` | the tenant's chrome — **wrong segment** |
| `  \| eRecruiting Swiss TPH` | the same thing, on a tenant that renamed it |

What follows the pipe is per-tenant and localised; **what is stable is that
nothing precedes it.** The script tests `title.startswith("|")`.

**So: read the segment from `/Jobs`, which links each vacancy with one that
works.** `umantis.py ad --id <n>` consults the listing before falling back to
probing `1…5`, and refuses rather than reporting an empty description.

> This corrects `shared/ats-open-check.md` as shipped in v1.5.0, which said the
> trailing `2` is required and is *not* a view index. It is one, it varies per
> vacancy, and hardcoding `2` returns the shell on three of BOBST's four current
> vacancies and on every Swiss TPH vacancy.

## Closed vacancies say so, with a status code

**`403` is the answer, and it is reliable** — the one thing a board never gives
you. Confirmed 2026-08-28 on two unrelated tenants and **at every segment**: an
unknown or withdrawn id answers `403`, not `404` and not a 200 with a banner.

| Response | Reading |
| :-- | :-- |
| `200` + a job title in `<title>` | **Open.** |
| `403` | **Not open** — closed, withdrawn, or never existed. |
| `200` + empty title slot on every segment tried | **Not an answer.** Wrong URL, not a dead ad. |

`umantis.py check --host … --id …` returns this as a verdict and exits `0` when
open, `1` otherwise. That is what `cover-letter` step 1b wants.

## Traps

**1. An unallocated tenant number answers `200` with the vendor's own
marketing page.** `recruitingapp-1000` and `recruitingapp-2000` both returned
*"Abacus Umantis – Die HR-Suite für DACH-Mittelständler"* with zero vacancies.
A wrong host therefore looks exactly like an employer with nothing open. The
script matches the vendor title and refuses; **never report that as an empty
board.** Non-existent numbers fail DNS instead, which is at least honest.

**2. Some vacancies are live but unlisted.** BOBST's `9151` — the Product Owner
role this plugin first met through a jobup ad — answers `200` with its full
description at `/2`, and does **not** appear in `/Jobs`. So the listing is not
the whole board, and an id that is absent from it is not evidence the ad closed.
Same shape as Ashby's `isListed: false`.

**3. Some tenants render their listing client-side, and then `/Jobs` carries no
vacancies at all.** Kanton St. Gallen returns `200` and 64 kB of chrome with
zero `/Vacancies/` links; its rows arrive from a `connectortable` widget, and
following that widget's own pagination parameters (`?tc<id>=p2`) still returns
none. **This is not an empty board.** The script detects the widget and says so
with its own exit code rather than printing nothing. Read such a tenant in the
browser, or reach a vacancy directly if you already have its id — `ad` and
`check` still work there, because the vacancy path does not depend on the
listing.

**4. There is no server-side search.** The whole board comes back — 2 to 10
vacancies on the tenants measured — and `--search` filters titles locally. When
that keeps nothing the script says *"the board is not empty; every vacancy was
filtered out"*, because zero results and zero matches are different facts.

**5. No structured data.** No JSON-LD, no microdata, no `JobPosting` markup.
Title and description come from the HTML, and there is no reliable posting date
or location field — do not invent one for the ledger.

## The one thing this family cannot do here: find the tenant

Workday, Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby all resolve an employer name to a tenant
through HiringCafe. **That route does not exist for umantis**, by the same
measurement that justifies the adapter: HiringCafe indexes none of it.

So `umantis.py` has **no `resolve` command**, deliberately. The host arrives:

- from the user, who names the employer's careers site;
- or from an `externalUrl` on a jobup, jobs.ch or job-room row — which is
  exactly how this ATS was first met (`shared/boards/jobup.md`);
- or from a web search for the employer plus *"umantis"* or *"/Vacancies/"*.

**Recognise it by the path**, `/Vacancies/<id>/Description/<n>`, never by the
host. Say *"give me their careers URL"* rather than guessing a tenant number:
the guess lands on the vendor's marketing page and looks like an answer.

## The ledger

```
umantis:<host>:<id>          e.g. umantis:jobs.bobst.com:9151
```

The host is part of the key for the reason it is on the other ATS boards: this
platform hosts one board per employer, and the id alone cannot rebuild a URL.
The segment is **not** in the key — it is a property of the page, recoverable
from the listing, and putting it in the key would freeze a value that the
employer can change when they add a language.

## Applying

umantis runs its own application flow, behind the vendor's account creation.
**The plugin does not create accounts and does not fill credential fields** —
hand the user the vacancy URL and their documents, as for any external ATS.

## Pace

Boards are small and requests are cheap. One `/Jobs` per employer per run, plus
one request per vacancy read, is the whole cost.

**Re-exercised 2026-09-08**: `list --host jobs.bobst.com` returns **10 of 10
vacancies**. *Two counts, and the second is the host's own.*
