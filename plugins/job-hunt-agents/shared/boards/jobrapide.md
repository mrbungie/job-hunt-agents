**`countries: TD` was NOT read from the domain. The domain names no country at
all** — `jobrapide.org` could be anywhere in francophone Africa, and that is
why this host sat unattributed in a list of nineteen for two days.

## How the country was attributed, and how strong that is

**By counting country names in the homepage body:**

```
tchad   79      congo 16      togo 13      burkina 10      guinée 9
```

**Chad dominates by a factor of five over the next name.** *That is a
mention count on one page — **not an enumeration of advertisements**, and this
card does not pretend otherwise.*

**What it establishes:** the corpus is Chad-centred. **What it does not:** the
share of advertisements per country, or whether the four other names are
sections, syndication, or noise. **`countries:` carries `TD` alone because that
is what the evidence supports; adding the other four would put four countries
into every aggregate on nine to sixteen mentions of a single page.**

*This is the counterpart of the rule that `countries` lists recruitment
jurisdictions rather than workplaces: a jurisdiction still has to be measured
before it is declared.*

### The measurement this card called for now exists — and it widens the line

**The card above says the mention count establishes *what* the corpus is
centred on and not *the share of advertisements per country*. That share has
now been sampled on a better instrument: the advertisement slugs themselves.**

```
30 ad slugs, from archive pages 1 / 3000 / 6181 of about 6 182
20 name a country · 10 name none

TD 9  ·  CM 2 · CG 2 · CI 1 · BJ 1 · BI 1 · MR 1 · ML 1 · SD 1 · SN 1
```

**Chad is nine of the twenty — a plurality, not the whole — and ten distinct
countries appear in thirty advertisements.** *So `TD` alone was not incomplete,
it was **known false**, and the line now carries the ten.*

**Read the ten as ten countries seen in thirty slugs, not as ten countries
measured.** *Thirty slugs against an inventory of roughly 66 000 is 0.05 % of
it. That is enough to establish that this board serves those jurisdictions; it
is **not** enough to move their coverage denominators, which is why the Atlas
was deliberately left alone on 2026-09-07.*

**And the extractor that produced this was wrong before it was right.** *Its
first form had no `burundi` and reported eleven slugs naming no country instead
of ten — a narrow extractor does not return **less**, it returns **false**, and
its silence has the shape of an absence. It was caught only by printing the
unmatched slugs; no total would ever have shown it.*

## Its rules refuse `ClaudeBot` and it serves us

```
GET /            → 200, 235 373 o, « Offres d'emplois, Bourses d'étude, Stage, Formations »
GET /robots.txt  → 200, 1 850 o, the Cloudflare managed block
                   `claudebot` named once · `claude-user` named zero times
                   NO Sitemap line — the route is the facet pages, not a file
```

**It carries scholarships and training beside jobs** — the title says so — **so
a count of pages under `/offres/` is not a count of advertisements until
someone reads them.** *That is the trap `angolaemprego.com` set with news
articles, and it is named here before anyone counts.*

**Somebody read them on 2026-09-07, and the fear was right: scholarships
outnumber recruitment notices.**

```
65 DISTINCT /offres/ URLs on the homepage  (122 link OCCURRENCES — two numbers)

16  /offres/bourses-etude/       scholarships  <- the largest category
10  /offres/avis-appel-offres/   procurement tenders, not advertisements
10  /offres/avis-recrutement/    recruitment notices
 8  /offres/ (no category)
 5  concours · 5 stage · 5 volontaire · 4 formations · 2 call-for-papers
```

> **Jobs are a minority of what this board posts, and the `/offres/` count in
> `content:` is a count of link occurrences, not of advertisements.**

## The pagination, measured rather than guessed

**Neither the homepage nor `/offres/<category>/` is a listing.**
*`/offres/avis-recrutement/` **redirects to a single article** —
`single-post postid-67526` — and only the provenance record showed it, because
`final_url` differed from `url`. Without that field this card would carry
"5 advertisements on 163 KB" measured on a page that is not a list.*

**The archive is the WordPress category route:**

```
/recrutement/offres/avis-recrutement/          body class = archive category-17
  page 1      10 ads    paginator says 6181
  page 3000   11 ads    paginator says 6182
  page 6181   11 ads    paginator says 6182   <- NOT empty
  page 9999   HTTP 404                        <- the announced bound is honest
```

**And the three pages serve different advertisements — 30 distinct out of 32,
the single common link being a sidebar item.** *Without that check, a paginator
that re-serves the same page reads exactly like one that works.*

**Order of magnitude: about 6 182 pages at roughly 10.7 advertisements each,
so of the order of 66 000 — and that is an ESTIMATE from three samples,
never a count.** *Pages 1 and 6181 are the two worst sampling points on their
own, which is why page 3000 is in the set.*

**No structured job data:** the single `ld+json` block declares
`@type: Article`, and `JobPosting` appears zero times. *An adapter here would
have to parse HTML.*

## Shipped 2026-09-07, and three things were measured that the card did not have

### Consecutive pages overlap, and not by a fixed amount

```
page 1 ∩ page 2   2 advertisements
page 2 ∩ page 3   0
page 3 ∩ page 4   1
40 rows read, 37 distinct — 7.5 % duplicated on this sample
```

**So `pages × 10` over-counts, and the overlap is not a constant offset that
could be subtracted.** The adapter deduplicates by URL and **reports how many
it dropped**: that figure is a property of the board, not an artefact to hide.

*The estimate above — about 6 182 pages at roughly 10.7 each, of the order of
66 000 — was taken without this correction. It is not made more precise here:
three samples plus a duplicate rate from four pages is still an estimate, and
saying so is cheaper than a number nobody can defend.*

### The dates are on the archive page, so `--since` costs no extra request

```
<h3><a href="/offres/<category>/<slug>/">title</a></h3>
<b>Publié le: <a href="/2026/09/07/">7 septembre 2026</a></b>
<ul class="post-categories"><li><a>Avis de recrutement</a>
```

**The date is taken from the `/YYYY/MM/DD/` permalink, not from the French
sentence beside it** — one is a machine's and the other is a month name.

### Reading the country per advertisement was tried and abandoned

**On 37 distinct slugs the extractor named a country for 26 and nothing for
11 — and three of those eleven are `mamoudzou-france`, `grand-est-strasbourg`
and `caritas-suisse`.**

> **This board carries advertisements outside the ten countries this card
> declares, and an extractor that knows only African names calls them "no
> country".**

*A narrow extractor does not return less, it returns false, and its silence
has the shape of an absence* — **which is the defect this card already records
having made once, reproduced on the first attempt at the same task.**

**So `countries` on a row carries the board's declared jurisdictions and
nothing is claimed per advertisement.** The ten stand as *seen in slugs*, and
the scope is now known to be **wider than the ten**, by at least two European
locations in 37 slugs. *That is a bound, not a count.*

## Pace

`Crawl-delay` is not set. **Eight requests have been made to this host in
total** — the root and the rules file on 2026-09-07 morning, then six on the
same day for the pagination: the homepage again, `/offres/avis-recrutement/`,
the archive and its pages 3000, 6181 and 9999. **Every one went through
`bin/fetch-body.py`, with the guard taken on the exact path in a turn of its
own.**
