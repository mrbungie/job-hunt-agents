# Board adapter — KarriereStart (Norway): reopened by the 2026-09-07 doctrine, and the transport refuses the client with a static 403 — and served to a browser

<!-- verified: 2026-09-13 -->

<!-- content: measured · **9 809 advertisements stated by the site** — «20794 ledige stillinger i 9809 annonser» on `/jobb` (20 794 positions in 9 809 advertisements: a headcount and an ad count, both stated, the second the one to count), 20 `/ledig-stilling/<id>` per page; page 1 read from a connected browser tab; no JobPosting on the advertisement page; the rules as on the 12th — `ClaudeBot` refused, `*` open, the 2026-09-07 doctrine and #230 · 2026-09-13 -->

**Measured 2026-09-12 at 15:27:58Z UTC for #233, lot 7 — a measurement of the
transport, not a decision about the host.** Every fetch under the declared
identity, the guard on the exact path first, by `bin/fetch-body.py
--allow-refusal` — the four records carry the status, the bytes, the md5 and
the `cf-ray` that answered.

## The rules — reopened by the doctrine of 2026-09-07 and by #230

```
robots.txt      read twice, certain: True, 2573 B, md5 656be9cf511b both times — `User-agent: ClaudeBot / Disallow: /`, `*` open
identity("/")   http, claude-user      <- the group naming ClaudeBot does not bind Claude-User (owner, 2026-09-07)
verdict()       sweep True, sweep_token claude-user   <- since #230 (2026-09-11)
allowed("/")    True
```

*The file is Cloudflare's managed content block — the `Content-Signal` preamble and nine named crawlers refused, `ClaudeBot` among them — followed by the operator's own lines (2 573 B in all).* Before the decision this host was read as closed by name; the decision reopened it on paper, and this card is the first time its transport was asked under the permitted token.

## The transport — a static 403, the provider default

```
GET https://karrierestart.no/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (15:27:58Z)
GET https://karrierestart.no/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
GET https://karrierestart.no/jobb     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (15:28:56Z)
GET https://karrierestart.no/jobb     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
```

**Same size, same md5 on four fetches, root and listing alike — a static
body, and it is the 25-byte default served by the same provider on unrelated
hosts** (`www.jobstore.com`, `www.hays.fr`, `kariera.mk`, `www.tala-com.com`,
`sptojobslink.com`, and the five of lot 1: the same bytes,
`9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf`). *A body shared between unrelated
hosts is a provider default, not a page anyone wrote for this host.* **The
rules permit and the transport refuses the client: family (1) of #222 — the
case where a browser is legitimate** (#66: it changes the layer, not the
permission). Not measured here: this session has no browser instrument; an
OPEN under a real browser would make this host a candidate for a browser
adapter, and that is the pilot's to assign.

## 2026-09-13 10:47 UTC — the browser route, MEASURED (#222): two figures on one line, and the card says which is which

One Claude-in-Chrome tab, the guard on `/jobb` and `/ledig-stilling/<id>`
first. **No challenge** — the 25-byte 403 goes to the declared client alone.

```
navigate /jobb                     200 «Ledige stillinger» — **«20794 ledige stillinger i 9809 annonser»** · 20 /ledig-stilling/<id> cards · facets by fylke, kommune, bransje, yrke
GET /ledig-stilling/3012380        200 «Product Lead - Gjensidige» — no JSON-LD, no JobPosting; «Søknadsfrist :» in the page text
```

**20 794 is a headcount — positions — and 9 809 is the count of
advertisements**; the same shape as `nea-gov-kh.md`'s 90 639, stated on
the same line here. The adapter counts advertisements against 9 809 and
never against 20 794. The pager's addresses carry query strings the
tooling masks; the procedure is: guard → tab → read the two figures →
walk the listing's pages 1.5 s apart, collecting `/ledig-stilling/<id>` →
**«n emitted, site states 9 809 advertisements (20 794 positions)»** →
the advertisement page's own fields (no JobPosting) → close. *One page of
20 was read.*

## What this card is, and is not

- **Not a verdict that the host is closed** — the owner's decision, on his
  express validation (rule of 2026-09-08). Recorded: one client, one day, two
  fetches each of the root and a listing path, a static refusal.
- **No script, no configuration.** A user with a URL from this host can hand
  it to `cover-letter`; whether that page is served to a browser is not
  established here.
- **Not an AfricaWork host**; the 25-byte refusal is the provider default shared with every static host of #233 — **the body says who fronts the site, not who runs it.** Norway's general board; the only Norwegian host of the 61.
