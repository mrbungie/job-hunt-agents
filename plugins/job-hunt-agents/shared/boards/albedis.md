**#189 asked for a measurement and named two traps. Both are answered here, and
the request's central premise is corrected.**

## The premise that was wrong — and it was wrong in the useful direction

**#189 records `AUCUN bloc JSON-LD JobPosting — l'extraction passe par le
HTML`.** *There is one on every advertisement.* **It simply does not parse**,
and a reader that concludes absence from a parse failure reports the site as
unstructured when it is fully structured.

**Two distinct malformations, and both are the site's:**

```
1  an array wrapped in quotes
   "employmentType" : "["FULL_TIME", "INTERN"]"     -> breaks the string

2  a raw control character inside a string
   "description" : "...\n..."                        -> strict JSON refuses
```

**Measured on four advertisements: all four need repair 1, one of the four also
needs lax parsing.** *A plain `json.loads` reads **0 of 4**.* **That is exactly
the observation that produced the false premise**, and it is why this card
records the repair rather than the conclusion.

*The same three-path reader that `careerical-sl.md` documents applies here —
try strict, then lax, each with and without the repair — and the order of
attempts is itself the finding.*

## Trap 1 — the neighbouring advertisements, and the bound is VERIFIED

**#189 is right that the page carries other advertisements' fields.** *Measured
across four pages:*

```
page                      ad ids in the HTML     JobPosting blocks
IT Solutions Specialist            5                     1
Verkaufsexperte                    6                     1
Supply Chain Coordinator           7                     1
Sales expert                       9                     1
```

**The HTML always names several advertisements; the `JobPosting` is always
exactly one.** *So the JSON-LD block IS the container — it is bounded to the
advertisement by construction, where any HTML selector sees between five and
nine.*

**This was checked on four pages rather than one**, which is what #189 asked
for: *a selector that works on a page with one advertisement can take the
neighbour on the next.* **Here the bound held on every page, including the one
carrying nine.**

## Trap 2 — the two identifiers, and which is the key

```
identifier.value   INT-121357            declared by the site in its JobPosting
URL id             3028979735            addresses the page
```

**Both are stable across the four language forms of the same advertisement** —
`/emploi/…-fr/`, `/stellenangebot/…-de/`, `/jobs/…-en/`,
`/annuncio-di-lavoro/…-it/` all carry id `3028979735` and identifier
`INT-121357`. *Verified by fetching the French and German forms and comparing.*

**The `INT-` prefix survived the merger — it is on all four sampled
advertisements — but its numeric part has TWO shapes:**

```
INT-120553          INT-121498          INT-121357        six digits
INT-4163915104116                                      thirteen digits
```

> **Recommended ledger key: the numeric URL id.** *It is uniform in shape, it is
> what `sitemap_jobs0.xml` enumerates, and it addresses the resource in all four
> languages.* **`INT-…` is the site's own declared identifier and should be
> carried alongside**, because it is the reference a recruiter would quote — but
> a parser that assumes six digits after `INT-` breaks on the sample above.

## The count, and the anchor that does not exist

```
sitemap_jobs0.xml   380 <loc>   95 under /emploi/   95 × 4 = 380
lastmod             2026-06-18 → 2026-09-08T06:23
```

**95 advertisements, and the four-language partition closes the arithmetic
exactly** — *which is what makes 95 a count of advertisements rather than of
URLs.*

**NAMED GAP: this site states no running total that this measurement found.**
*Unlike `rocken.jobs`, which puts `6104 offene Stellen` in its `<title>`, and
`jobs.af` and `kalibrr`, whose APIs return their own `count`.* **So 95 is our
enumeration of the site's sitemap, not the site's own figure**, and if the
reader broke, 95 and 0 would be two outputs of one instrument.

*Two listing paths were guessed and both answered 404 — `/emplois/` and
`/jobs/`. `/jobs/` is a language prefix for English advertisements, not a
listing. The sitemap was read instead of a third guess.*

## The employer is the agency, on every advertisement

**`hiringOrganization.name` is `albedis` on all four sampled advertisements**,
and the description says *"Notre client, acteur majeur du secteur de la
construction"* — the end employer is deliberately unnamed.

**This is the fourth host in one day with that shape**, after `rocken.jobs`
(`ROCKEN` on 6 105), `eshjob.com` (18 cards, one poster account) and one other.
**An adapter must leave the employer empty and say why.**

## What is not established

**No script ships**, and under the owner's decision of 2026-09-08 that is a
measurement owed rather than a renunciation.

**Four advertisements of 95 were parsed.** *The container bound, the repair
requirement and the agency-as-employer are observed on four, not demonstrated on
95.*

**The `DDMMYY`-style suffix seen on other Swiss hosts does not appear here**;
the slug ends in a language tag instead.


## 2026-09-08 — shipped

**`albedis.py sitemap` returns the 95 advertisements; `albedis.py ad --url`
reads one.** *Both were run, not read.*

```
380 <loc>      380 matched the advertisement shape, 0 did not
 95 distinct ids, and every one carries exactly 4 language forms
```

**The reader is not in this adapter.** *The malformation is a type confusion —
a JSON array serialised into a string and emitted unescaped — and `_ldjson`
mends it since `ed57b58`.* **This adapter calls `postings()` and
`absent_reason()`**, so a page that announces a `JobPosting` and yields none
exits loudly instead of emitting a row: *a parse failure is INDETERMINATE, never
ABSENT, which is the mistake #189 recorded as a fact about the site.*

### What it emits, and the three things it refuses to assert

**`depositor`, not `employer`.** *`hiringOrganization` reads `albedis` on every
advertisement measured and the descriptions say "Notre client".* **The field is
carried under a name that does not claim what it does not know** — on other
hosts the same field IS the employer, so dropping it would discard a correct
value elsewhere.

**No composed addresses.** *Every URL comes from the sitemap as found.* **A
composed address on a neighbouring host answered HTTP 200 and led nowhere**,
which is indistinguishable from a live link and would have reached the ledger.

**The ledger key is the numeric URL id.** *`INT-…` travels beside it as
`reference` because it is what a recruiter quotes, and it has two lengths —
`INT-121357` and `INT-4163915104116` — so a parser assuming six digits breaks.*

### The gap, named rather than filled

**This site declares no running total.** *So 95 is this adapter's enumeration of
the site's sitemap and nothing external checks it.* **`95 × 4 = 380` compares
the sitemap with ITSELF**: a partition of one's own output is an arithmetic
identity and cannot fail while the reading fails. *It is printed as a
consistency check and never as a witness.*

*And had a total existed, it would still have needed showing that it counts
advertisements: on `xpress.jobs` the board's own `recordCount` is a genuinely
external figure that counts row slots, and 37 % of the rows it counts are
repeats.*

### Not established

**Four advertisements of 95 were parsed** when this host was measured, and the
container bound, the repair requirement and the agency-as-depositor rest on
those four. *The `sitemap` command reads all 95 addresses; it does not open
them.*

**The pacing is a default, not a margin.** *2 s, ours, and no rate limit was
measured on this host* — unlike `xpress.jobs`, where 1.5 s was shown to take an
HTTP 400 at the 26th request.
