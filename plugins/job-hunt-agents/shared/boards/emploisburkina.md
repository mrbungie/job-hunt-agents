**Burkina Faso had no card in this repository.** This one records a
measurement that **stopped**, and why.

## The network, re-verified today

`emploisburkina.bf` declares its sitemap on **another host** —
`https://afriqueemplois.com/sitemap.xml` — and the guard was taken there in
its own turn.

```
2026-09-04 (country page)   149 advertisements · 25 for Burkina
2026-09-07 (this reading)   141 advertisements · 23 for Burkina

partition        141 ids, 141 distinct, ZERO present on two domains
                 afriqueemplois.com 75 · emploiivoire.ci 37
                 emploisburkina.bf  23 · emploisenegal.sn  6
lastmod          141 of 141, 2026-01-12 … 2026-09-07
```

**The third archetype holds three days later**, on a smaller inventory.
*And the dates are on the sitemap, which the country page does not record:
freshness is measurable here without opening an advertisement.*

**`sitemap-jobs-BF.xml` still answers with 6 615 bytes that are not a
sitemap** — the country page called it a Laravel error page and the byte count
is identical. **The general file is what carries the Burkinabè URLs.**

## What six probes showed, and why they are not twenty-three

```
5 of 6   redirect to https://emploisburkina.bf/ — the HOMEPAGE title
1 of 6   serves a real advertisement, `JobPosting` present
         « World Vision recrute un Directeur en Recherche stratégique »
```

**Without `final_url` the five would have been counted as advertisements**, at
272 KB of homepage each. *That field is why this card does not open with a
count of 23.*

**And the behaviour belongs to the domain, not to the network**:
`afriqueemplois.com` served both its probes, `emploiivoire.ci` one of two,
`emploisenegal.sn` redirected both to `/sn`.

## The measurement stopped, and the cause is mine

**Reading all 23 was the right instinct — 23 is small, and a rate on six is
worse than a count on twenty-three.** It failed:

```
23 attempted · 1 answered · 22 failed at the transport
~32 requests to this host in about 90 seconds
     9 through bin/fetch-body.py, 16:29:54Z … 16:31:06Z
    23 in a sweep that paced itself at 1 s and knew nothing of the 9
```

**The host answered every probe minutes earlier and then stopped.** *The most
likely reading is that the rate was mine.* **No count is published, and
`content:` says `indeterminate` rather than a zero** — *a zero manufactured by
one's own request rate is the defect this repository has already paid for.*

### Two faults in my own instrument, and the second is worse

**`Pace` is per-process.** The sweep started fresh and had no knowledge of the
nine requests already made from another script. **Two tools pacing correctly
can still hammer a host together**, and nothing in either one can see it.

**And the sweep recorded `code: null` with no reason.** The exception text was
discarded, so the record cannot distinguish a refusal from a timeout from a
reset — *the failure is attested and its nature is not.* **A record that
cannot say why is why this card cannot say what.**

## What remains to be done, and it is not more requests today

**Re-read the 23 after a pause, from one process, at a slower rate.** The
sitemap is on a third host and costs one request; the 23 are the whole
Burkinabè inventory of this network.

*And the question that decides whether an adapter is worth writing is already
sharp: if five in six of the listed URLs redirect to the root, this facade
lists far more than it serves, and the board carrying the matter is
`afriqueemplois.com`.*


## 2026-09-08 — remeasured, and the pacing theory does not survive it

**The 2026-09-07 card blamed our own rate:** *~32 requests in 90 s, 22 of 23
failing.* **Today's run used 10 s spacing — 6 requests a minute, roughly a
third of that — and the host still cut us off.**

```
ordre des 24, 09:01 -> 09:07:16 UTC
.....A..AAAxxxxxxxxxxxxx
. redirect to root (271 550 bytes, identical)   A real JobPosting   x unreadable

11 requests answered, then 13 consecutive failures and no recovery
```

**What the 13 are, exactly — and they are not refusals.**

```
INDETERMINATE: robots.txt could not be read after 3 attempt(s):
               <urlopen error [Errno 61] Connection refused>
```

**The guard could not be taken, so nothing was fetched.** *`fetch-body.py`
declined rather than reaching for the page without a verdict, which is the
behaviour it was written for.* **13 unknown is not 13 closed**, and this card
does not count them either way.

### What this measures, and what it retracts

| of the 24 URLs the network attributes to this host | |
| :-- | --: |
| serve a real `JobPosting`, no redirect | **4** |
| redirect to the site root — 271 550 bytes, identical to the byte | **7** |
| unreadable, connection refused at the guard | **13** |

**So the live inventory is between 4 and 17.** *Four is measured; seventeen is
four plus the thirteen unknowns; and no figure of 23, 24 or 25 was ever a count
of live advertisements — those are counts of URLs in a third party's sitemap.*

**And the redirects are why `final_url` was in the protocol.** *All seven answer
HTTP 200 with a 271 550-byte body.* **Without recording where they landed, all
seven would have been counted as advertisements** — a plausible 11 instead of a
measured 4.

### The pacing theory is now doubtful, and that changes the prescription

**Yesterday's reading was "a rate that was ours". At a third of that rate the
host still stopped, after 11 requests rather than after 90 seconds.** *That
points at a cumulative count rather than a rate* — **and if it is cumulative,
waiting longer between runs does not help, which is exactly what yesterday's
prescription assumed.**

**This is a hypothesis and not a measurement.** *One request 35 seconds after
the run was also refused, and 35 seconds is not a test of recovery.* **What
would test it: a single request after a long idle period.** *Two observations
now share a shape; neither isolates the variable, and the honest reading is that
we do not know what trips it.*

## 2026-09-13 — #283: a timeout on the rules file is an absence of rules — and today the file reads

The INDETERMINATE of 2026-09-08 («could not be read after 3 attempt(s)») was
a verdict on a rules file that did not answer; since #283 (owner's decision
of 2026-09-13) that is `no-rules-timeout`, open on `certain: False`, with the
first transport request waiting 10 s. On 2026-09-13 it does not even come to that:
`/robots.txt` **reads** (348 B, `sweep: True, certain: True`) and the root
answers **200, 309 107 B, twice** (15:28:52Z, 15:28:55Z, the host's
`Crawl-delay: 1` honoured). *The measurement above stands as dated; the
host is served today.*

## 2026-09-14 10:47–10:53 UTC — the host answers, the site has changed, and the list is locked

The host that refused connections after the eleventh request on
2026-09-08 answered every request today (7, at 3 s; `Crawl-delay: 1` in
the rules). The site is a new build — a WordPress-less app of the
Afrique Emplois network (`afriqueemplois.com`, with `/ci`, `/sn` … fronts
and per-country job sitemaps declared there):

```
GET /robots.txt               200 — * Allow /, Disallow /api/, /login, /register, /forgot-password, /profile, /subscription, /talents/create; Sitemap https://afriqueemplois.com/sitemap.xml; Crawl-delay 1
GET /                         200, 298 610 B — «Offres d'emploi 2305 offres», CollectionPage numberOfItems 2305, #posts-container with 3 /post/<id> cards and «EXCLUSIF» cards that open a subscription modal; the rest by fetch(`/api/load-more?page=…`)
GET /category/12              200, 254 779 B — «165 offres d'emploi dans la catégorie», numberOfItems 165, 4 cards, the rest by /api/load-more?page=N&category=12
GET /post/38265               200, 92 649 B — «Caritas Suisse recrute 03 experts», «Date limite: 14 sept. 2026», the body (an e-mail in it), «Postuler»; WebSite / Organization / BreadcrumbList JSON-LD, no JobPosting
GET afriqueemplois.com/sitemap.xml            200 — 22 files: sitemap-jobs.xml and 17 sitemap-jobs-<CC>.xml
GET afriqueemplois.com/sitemap-jobs-BF.xml    500, 6 615 B — twice (10:52, 10:53); sitemap-jobs.xml 500 as well
```

**What this leaves.** The count is stated and read; the list is locked
three ways — the pager is an `/api/` route the rules refuse in writing
(honoured by every route, a tab included: the plugin does not scroll a
page into a refused call), the «EXCLUSIF» advertisements are behind a paid
subscription, and the network's sitemap that would name every post
answers 500 today. A script would emit the three or four cards of the
root and of each category page — a score of advertisements against a
stated 2 305, «short» by design — which is something rendered and next to
nothing covered; the pilot decides whether that counts (#404). **Next
control 2026-09-21**: the BF sitemap of `afriqueemplois.com`; if it
answers, it is the inventory and a script follows.

## 2026-09-14 11:0x–11:2x UTC — the adapter, on the pilot's reading

The pilot's decision, to cite as such: *«ça compte — #404 dit "un script
qui ne rend RIEN ne compte pas"; une vingtaine d'annonces ouvertes n'est
pas rien, et le défaut du propriétaire est qu'on utilise le board. Ce qui
ferme est la ROUTE vers le reste, pas le board»* (carried to the owner to
reverse if he wants). So **`emploisburkina.py`** reads only what the site
serves without exception:

```
list    the root and the five category pages (/category/12, 13, 14, 16, 25), 3 s apart — the open cards (/post/<id>: title, excerpt, level badge, date), the «EXCLUSIF» cards counted and never opened; «22 emitted from 6 page(s) (66 exclusive card(s) set aside …), the site states 2 305 — 2 283 short» on the day
ad      /post/<id> — the <h1>, «Date limite», the body up to «POSTULER», scrubbed of e-mail addresses and Burkinabè telephone numbers; no JobPosting on this site today
never   /api/load-more (refused in writing, exit 7 before the gate), the accounts, /subscription, an exclusive card
```

**`route: http · 22 · 2026-09-14`**, with «2 305 stated» on the witness
line: the number is small because the list beyond the fifteen cards a
page is a refused route and the exclusives are a paid product — the
shortfall is the site's, printed on every run and never filled. The
control of the network's sitemap (2026-09-21) stands: if
`afriqueemplois.com/sitemap-jobs-BF.xml` answers, it is the inventory and
`list` grows to it.
