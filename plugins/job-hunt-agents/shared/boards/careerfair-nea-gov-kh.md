# Board adapter — NEA Career Fair (Cambodia): reopened by the 2026-09-07 doctrine, and the transport refuses the client with a static 403 — and served to a browser

<!-- verified: 2026-09-13 -->

<!-- hosts: careerfair.nea.gov.kh, www.careerfair.nea.gov.kh -->
<!-- script: none -->
<!-- countries: KH -->
<!-- content: measured · **534 advertisements by the pager's arithmetic** — `/jobs` serves 30 `/jobs/detail/<id>` a page, a pager «1 2 3 … 17 18», page 18 carries 24: 17 × 30 + 24 = 534 (pages 1, 2 and 18 read from a connected browser tab, 0 shared between 1 and 2); the site states no total; the National Employment Agency's career-fair board, beside `nea.gov.kh`; the rules as on the 12th — `ClaudeBot` refused, `*` open, the 2026-09-07 doctrine and #230 · 2026-09-13 -->
<!-- witness: the pager's last page — 24 on page 18 against 30 on the others closes the arithmetic at 534; no figure is stated by the site · 2026-09-13 -->
<!-- route: browser · 534 · 2026-09-13 -->

**Measured 2026-09-12 at 12:22:44Z UTC for #233, lot 6 — a measurement of the
transport, not a decision about the host.** Every fetch under the declared
identity, the guard on the exact path first, by `bin/fetch-body.py
--allow-refusal` — the four records carry the status, the bytes, the md5 and
the `cf-ray` that answered.

## The rules — reopened by the doctrine of 2026-09-07 and by #230

```
robots.txt      read twice, certain: True, 1860 B, md5 2a0812ac5756 both times — `User-agent: ClaudeBot / Disallow: /`, `*` open
identity("/")   http, claude-user      <- the group naming ClaudeBot does not bind Claude-User (owner, 2026-09-07)
verdict()       sweep True, sweep_token claude-user   <- since #230 (2026-09-11)
allowed("/")    True
```

*The file is Cloudflare's managed content block — the `Content-Signal` preamble and nine named crawlers refused, `ClaudeBot` among them — followed by one operator group, `User-agent: * / Disallow:` — empty (1 860 B in all).* Before the decision this host was read as closed by name; the decision reopened it on paper, and this card is the first time its transport was asked under the permitted token.

## The transport — a static 403, the provider default

```
GET https://careerfair.nea.gov.kh/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (12:22:44Z)
GET https://careerfair.nea.gov.kh/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
GET https://careerfair.nea.gov.kh/jobs     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (12:24:52Z)
GET https://careerfair.nea.gov.kh/jobs     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
```

**Same size, same md5 on four fetches, root and listing alike — a static
body, and it is the 25-byte default served by the same provider on unrelated
hosts** (`www.jobstore.com`, `www.hays.fr`, `kariera.mk`, `www.tala-com.com`,
`sptojobslink.com`, and the five of lot 1: the same bytes,
`9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf`). *A body shared between unrelated
hosts is a provider default, not a page anyone wrote for this host.* **The
rules permit and the transport refuses the client: family (1) of #222 — the
case where a browser is legitimate** (#66: it changes the layer, not the
permission). Not measured here: this session has no browser instrument; an
OPEN under a real browser would make this host a candidate for a browser
adapter, and that is the pilot's to assign.

## 2026-09-13 11:00 UTC — the browser route, MEASURED (#222): the pager closes the count the site does not state

```
navigate /jobs             200 «ឱកាសការងារ» — 30 /jobs/detail/<id> cards (employer · title · sector · phone · province · «មើលលម្អិត») · pager ‹ 1 2 3 … 17 18 ›
fetch /jobs?page=2         30 cards, 0 shared with page 1
fetch /jobs?page=18        24 cards  →  **17 × 30 + 24 = 534**       11:00:52 UTC
```

No challenge; the 25-byte 403 is for the declared client alone. **534 is
an arithmetic over the pager, not a figure the site states** — the card
says so; the sister host `nea.gov.kh` states a headcount and this one
states nothing. The procedure: guard → tab → `page=1 … 18` 1.5 s apart
collecting `/jobs/detail/<id>` → «n emitted; the site states no total,
the pager closes at 534» → an advertisement page (not opened) → close.

## What this card is, and is not

- **Not a verdict that the host is closed** — the owner's decision, on his
  express validation (rule of 2026-09-08). Recorded: one client, one day, two
  fetches each of the root and a listing path, a static refusal.
- **No script, no configuration.** A user with a URL from this host can hand
  it to `cover-letter`; whether that page is served to a browser is not
  established here.
- **The NEA's career-fair host**, sibling of `www.nea.gov.kh` — the same 25-byte refusal one second apart. *Whether it publishes vacancies of its own or mirrors the portal is not established: nothing was served.*
