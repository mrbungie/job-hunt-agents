# Board adapter — GjejPunë24 (Albania): reopened by the 2026-09-07 doctrine, and the transport refuses the client with a static 403 — and served to a browser, empty

<!-- verified: 2026-09-13 -->

<!-- hosts: gjejpune24.com, www.gjejpune24.com -->
<!-- script: none -->
<!-- countries: AL -->
<!-- content: indeterminate · the tab is served (no challenge) and the page never fills: `/pune` (the card's path) is a Next.js «404: This page could not be found», `/` redirects to `/sq` titled «Punë në Evropë – gjej-pune.com» and renders skeleton placeholders with **zero characters of text after nine seconds and no data call** — not a listing, not an empty listing, a shell; the rules as on the 12th — `ClaudeBot` refused, `*` open, the 2026-09-07 doctrine and #230 · 2026-09-13 -->
<!-- witness: none — nothing on the page states anything; the title names another brand (gjej-pune.com, «jobs in Europe») · 2026-09-13 -->
<!-- route: none · the page renders a skeleton and never fills — zero text, no data request, after nine seconds in a tab; the site's own title says «Punë në Evropë – gjej-pune.com», another brand · 2026-09-13 -->

**Measured 2026-09-12 at 11:18:31Z UTC for #233, lot 4 — a measurement of the
transport, not a decision about the host.** Every fetch under the declared
identity, the guard on the exact path first, by `bin/fetch-body.py
--allow-refusal` — the four records carry the status, the bytes, the md5 and
the `cf-ray` that answered.

## The rules — reopened by the doctrine of 2026-09-07 and by #230

```
robots.txt      read twice, certain: True, 1836 B, md5 c6370d4bc025 both times — `User-agent: ClaudeBot / Disallow: /`, `*` open
identity("/")   http, claude-user      <- the group naming ClaudeBot does not bind Claude-User (owner, 2026-09-07)
verdict()       sweep True, sweep_token claude-user   <- since #230 (2026-09-11)
allowed("/")    True
```

*The file is Cloudflare's managed content block, byte for byte — the
`Content-Signal` preamble and nine named crawlers refused, `ClaudeBot` among
them — with not one line of the operator's own.* Before the decision this
host was read as closed by name; the decision reopened it on paper, and this
card is the first time its transport was asked under the permitted token.

## The transport — a static 403, the provider default

```
GET https://gjejpune24.com/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (11:18:31Z)
GET https://gjejpune24.com/          403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
GET https://gjejpune24.com/pune     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (11:20:44Z)
GET https://gjejpune24.com/pune     403, 25 B, md5 9ccabba20b9f    (second fetch)
```

**Same size, same md5 on four fetches, root and listing alike — a static
body, and it is the 25-byte default served by the same provider on unrelated
hosts** (`www.jobstore.com`, `www.hays.fr`, `kariera.mk`, `www.tala-com.com`,
`sptojobslink.com`, and the five of lot 1: the same bytes,
`9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf`). *A body shared between unrelated
hosts is a provider default, not a page anyone wrote for this host.* **The
rules permit and the transport refuses the client: family (1) of #222 — the
case where a browser is legitimate** (#66: it changes the layer, not the
permission). Not measured here: this session has no browser instrument; an
OPEN under a real browser would make this host a candidate for a browser
adapter, and that is the pilot's to assign.

## 2026-09-13 10:55 UTC — the browser route: served, and a shell that never fills (#222)

```
navigate /pune          200 «404: This page could not be found.» — a Next.js not-found page (33 characters of text)
navigate /              -> /sq, «Punë në Evropë – gjej-pune.com» — grey skeleton blocks where a hero, a nav and three cards would be
after 3 s, then 9 s     body.innerText = «» (zero characters) · 0 links · no XHR beyond /site.webmanifest
```

**No challenge, and no content**: a route to nothing, and the reason is
the page, not the door. *«Punë në Evropë» — jobs in Europe — and the
brand in the title is `gjej-pune.com`, not this host: the site may be a
front for another, or an unfinished build.* Nothing to count; the card
declares `route: none` with that reason, and what reopens it is a page
that fills.

## What this card is, and is not

- **Not a verdict that the host is closed** — the owner's decision, on his
  express validation (rule of 2026-09-08). Recorded: one client, one day, two
  fetches each of the root and a listing path, a static refusal.
- **No script, no configuration.** A user with a URL from this host can hand
  it to `cover-letter`; whether that page is served to a browser is not
  established here.
- **Same 1 836-byte managed block and same 25-byte refusal** as `duapune.com` (lot 1) and the AfricaWork hosts (#233 lists it under «another managed block naming ClaudeBot») — **one read of this host, dated, not a verdict copied from a sibling**: the third Albanian host of the list, `albaniajobs.al`, answers 200 in the same minute.
