# Board adapter — Práca SME (`praca.sme.sk`, Slovakia — the daily SME's board): the rules path answers a moving «Security Verification» challenge, every page a static 402 «Please contact the site owner for access» — measured twice on 2026-09-14, no adapter, a browser candidate not yet measured (#346)

**Two refusals of two kinds, and the one that matters for the browser
branch is the static one.** Issue #346 (Slovakia; #291 bloc C) named a
402 on the root on 2026-09-13; on 2026-09-14 the declared client, guard
on the exact path, read:

| address | answer | reads |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/robots.txt` | **403**, 22 955 B, «Security Verification \| SME», captcha/challenge in the body, **md5 moving** | 2 |
| `/` | **402**, 55 B, `{"message":"Please contact the site owner for access."}`, **md5 identical** (`48817d6864f7`) | 3 (and the country search's read of 2026-09-13: the same md5) |
| `/ponuky` | 402, the same 55 B | 1 |
| `https://www.praca.sk/` | redirects to `praca.sme.sk/`, the same 402 | 1 |

## What this is, under the doctrine

- **The rules path is behind a challenge** — a page whose purpose is to tell
  a robot from a person. Under #283 an unreadable `robots.txt` is an absence
  of rules (`certain: False`); the challenge on that path is not defeated
  and is not the site's answer about its pages.
- **The pages answer a static 402** — 55 bytes, the same md5 on four reads
  over two days, a JSON message, not a challenge: the `jobstore` family,
  not the `revolico` family. Under the 2026-09-07 doctrine a static refusal
  served to the declared client is a **browser candidate**: borne 0 asks
  whether a real browser is served the same 402 (the editor's refusal to
  everyone) or the board (an infrastructure that does not know who we are).
- **That measurement is not made here**: the session that wrote this card
  has no browser attached (the Chrome extension was not connected on
  2026-09-14 02:4x UTC). So this card carries no `route:` line — neither
  `browser · N` nor `none` — and the issue stays open for a session with a
  tab: one visit to `https://praca.sme.sk/`, the count the list states,
  the walk to it; or the same 402 in the tab, and then `route: none · the
  402 is served to a browser too · <date>`, which the owner validates
  (§2 sexies).

## What the board is, from outside

`praca.sk` — the historic Slovak board — redirects to `praca.sme.sk`, the
daily SME's job section. Nothing of its inventory was read: no count, no
card, no ad page. Slovakia's read boards on this day: Profesia
(`profesia.md`), the public employment service (`sluzbyzamestnanosti.md`,
which republishes Profesia, Kariéra and four others, not this one) and
Kariéra (`kariera.md`).

## Browser reading, 2026-09-14 09:12–09:13 UTC (#346)

The extension answered this session, so the browser candidate above was
measured from a connected tab: `https://praca.sme.sk/` → **redirected to
`https://www.sme.sk/`**, the newspaper's front page (news, sport, weather —
no job listing on it); `https://praca.sme.sk/ponuky` → the same
`www.sme.sk/`; `https://www.praca.sk/` → the same; the root again a minute
later → the same. **The 402 is what the declared client gets; a browser is
not challenged and not refused — it is sent to the daily's home.** Nothing
under this host served a list, a count or an advertisement to a browser
either. So: `route: none`, with the reason and the date; the reading is
«the board no longer lives here» (the `bestzambiajobs` form: a hostname
that survives its board), and the word «closed» stays the owner's
(§2 sexies). Slovakia's boards read on this day are Profesia, the public
employment service, Kariéra, Práca za rohom, Worki and Trenkwalder.

## 2026-09-14 11:0x UTC — non faisable, validé par le propriétaire

**non faisable — validé par le propriétaire le 14.09.2026 (verbatim : « 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 => exclue »)** — relayed verbatim by the pilot (#346). What was measured above is the measurement; the word «closed» is the owner's, and he has given it: the host sends a real browser to www.sme.sk, the daily's front page — the board no longer lives here (2026-09-14); the declared client gets a 402. The card stays as the record of the measurements; `route: none` is dated and motivated by this line, and the Atlas excludes the entry from the feasible denominator (#404). What would reopen it is written in the sections above; nothing is scheduled.
