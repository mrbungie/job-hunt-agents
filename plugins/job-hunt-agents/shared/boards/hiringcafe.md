## Route 2 of #102 is measured, and it is closed

**The issue asked whether there is an open door beside the forced one** — the
rules permit `/jobs`, `/recently-posted-jobs` and declare six sitemaps, and
that was to be established by measurement rather than supposition.

Measured **2026-09-05 10:45 UTC**, under `Claude-User`, collection having been
resumed:

```
sitemap.xml · jobs-sitemap.xml · job-search-sitemap.xml
job-posting-sitemap.xml · priority-jobs-sitemap.xml · vip-jobs-sitemap.xml
    all six      HTTP 403, 25 bytes, "Your request was blocked."
/jobs · /recently-posted-jobs · /job/<id> · /
    all four     HTTP 403, 25 bytes, identical body
```

**There is no open door.** The rules permit those paths and the infrastructure
refuses every one of them.

**And the body is a fingerprint we already hold**: md5 `9ccabba20b9f`, byte-for
-byte identical to `kariera.mk` (North Macedonia), `sptojobslink.com` (South
Pacific), `northcyprus.cv` (Eastern Mediterranean) and `jobs.af` (Afghanistan).
**Five hosts, five regions, one 25-byte body served with HTTP 200 or 403.** The
operator is not named here — an identical artefact does not establish a common
actor, which is the distinction the managed-block family cost us.

**So `hiringcafe.com` is the second known specimen of *rules open,
infrastructure closed*, after `tala-com.com`** — and `identity()` classifies it
`http`, because it decides on the rules and not on what the host does next.
That gap is real and is recorded rather than patched here.

### Re-measured 2026-09-07 11:19-11:24 UTC — it holds, and one path does not

**Two days apart, the same result: the six sitemaps, `/` and `/jobs` all answer
403 with the same 25-byte body.** *A behaviour seen once is dated and could be
an intermittence; seen twice, two days apart, it is the host's settled
posture.*

**But `/robots.txt` answers 200, 1 158 bytes, from the same edge in the same
minute.**

```
/robots.txt   HTTP 200   1 158 o   md5 529adb109a6b
/             HTTP 403      25 o   md5 9ccabba20b9f
/jobs         HTTP 403      25 o   md5 9ccabba20b9f
six sitemaps  HTTP 403      25 o   md5 9ccabba20b9f   (all six, same body)
```

> **The edge is not dark to us: it serves the file that permits, and refuses
> every path that file permits.** *That is a sharper statement of «&nbsp;rules
> open, infrastructure closed&nbsp;» than the card carried — the two answers come
> from the same host, the same client and the same declared identity, minutes
> apart.*

**And the fingerprint family is larger than the five named above.** Measured
here on 2026-09-07, each host fetched **twice**:

```
jobstore.com    403   25 o   md5 9ccabba20b9f   x2, IDENTICAL
www.hays.fr     403   25 o   md5 9ccabba20b9f   x2, IDENTICAL
```

**Fetching twice is the precondition, not a precaution**: a refusal body that
carries a rendering element — a `cf-ray` inside the body rather than the header
— changes md5 on every request, and any cross-host comparison of it is void.
*These do not move, so the comparison is sound.* **Seven hosts now, of which
these two carry this session's own provenance and the other five are the
2026-09-05 measurement above.**

*`www.hays.fr` declares `Crawl-delay: 10` and it was obeyed — **a host that
refuses at the edge still gets its declared rate honoured**, because the rate
is written by the operator and the refusal is not.*

**What this does NOT establish**: whether the 403 targets this client or every
client. *That question is settled by reading one of these hosts in a real
browser, and it has not been done here.*

A **meta-board**: HiringCafe crawls employer career pages across some forty ATS
platforms and republishes them under one search. Worldwide — every country
tested returned local ads (see *Coverage*, below).

**Everything here was verified against the live site on 2026-08-27.** Field
names and enum values rot; re-check before trusting an old note.

**It is not an aggregator in the sense `shared/pipeline-format.md` blocklists.**
Repost farms recycle titles, name no employer and lead nowhere. Every card here
names the employer, carries the ATS it came from and links to that employer's
own application page. **Do not discard these ads as aggregator noise** — they
are employer postings, reached through a different door.

## What makes it different from every other adapter

**It needs no browser.** The `/api/search-jobs` endpoint answers 401, but the
page is server-rendered: the whole result set sits in `__NEXT_DATA__`. So the
adapter is plain HTTP — no Chrome extension, no login, no anti-bot challenge
seen. It is the only sweep that still works when the extension is missing.

Use the script, not hand-rolled requests:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/job-scan/scripts/hiringcafe.py" \
  search --country CH --posted-within week --sort date --pages 3
```

Resolve the interpreter the portable way (`for c in python3 python py; do …`,
see `shared/portability.md`) — the script imports nothing outside the standard
library, on purpose.


## `countries` is not a place of work

**It lists the jurisdictions an employer is willing to hire from**, and on a
remote ad that is **6.5 of them on average** against 1.9 on the rest. It is not
where the work happens, and it is not even where the employer is.

Measured on 200 Ghanaian cards, 2026-09-02 — of the 71 carrying a Gulf state
in `countries`:

| | |
| :-- | --: |
| also carrying a Gulf **city** | **2 of 71 — 3%** |
| carrying **no city at all** | 45 |
| remote | 66 of 71 — **93%** |
| their actual cities | London 4 · San Francisco 4 · New York 3 · Singapore 3 |

Recomputed on `cities` instead, the gap reaches a factor of thirty: Ghana 30%
against **1%**, Tanzania 29% against **1%**, Nigeria 24% against **0%**.

**The risk is not missing an ad — it is presenting one as local when it is
not.** A remote ad open to six jurisdictions including Switzerland **is** worth
finding; that is what this plugin is for. It is simply not a Swiss job, and
**the commute rule has nothing to apply to.**

**What the code does today, checked rather than assumed (2026-09-02):**
`hiringcafe.py` emits `cities` and `countries` as separate raw fields, **the
city filter reads `cities` alone** — a card with an empty `cities` is dropped
by a city filter rather than matched on its country — and **nothing in
`shared/scoring-rubric.md` or either SKILL scores on `countries`.** So this is
a documentation fix, not a code one.

**What it needs from a reader is one distinction**: a card with a country list
and **no city** is *"remote, open to your country"*, never *"a job in your
country"*. They are two different results and confusing them is what produced
the error. Caveat 7 already says the right thing for `cities`; **it matters
more here, because 63% of these cards have no city to fall back on.**

*(A second property, of the instrument rather than the field: these cards are
largely **the same cards** from one country to the next — 68 of the 71 Ghanaian
ones appear in the Tanzanian sample, 65 in the Ugandan. **The thinner a market's
own data, the more of the answer is non-local ads.** So on a small market the
volume returned does not say what is covered; the number of cards carrying a
city in that country does.)*

## Configuration

```yaml
boards:
  hiringcafe:
    enabled: true
    country: "CH"            # ISO-2. Required.
    # Optional, and only as a complete set — see the city trap below:
    city: "Lausanne"
    region: "Vaud"           # canton / state / département
    lat: 46.5197
    lon: 6.6323
    radius: 25
    radius_unit: "miles"     # or "kilometers"
```

| Key | Required | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `enabled` | yes | False or absent → not scanned |
| `country` | yes | **ISO-2 code**, not a name. `CH`, `FR`, `DE` |
| `city` | no | Only with `region`, `lat` and `lon`. Any one missing → **0 results, no error** |
| `region` | with `city` | The `administrative_area_level_1` name |
| `lat` / `lon` | with `city` | The site has no public geocoder, so coordinates are stored once at setup, not looked up per scan |
| `radius` | no | Default 25 |
| `radius_unit` | no | `miles` (default) or `kilometers` |

Ask for the city coordinates at `/job-setup` time, once, and write them down.
**Never invent them**: wrong coordinates return a plausible result set centred
on the wrong place, which is worse than an error.

## Prerequisites

1. **Nothing.** No login, no account, no browser, no extension.
2. Say that plainly when the user enables it — after LinkedIn's requirements it
   sounds like something is missing.

## Building a search

The whole query is one URL parameter, `searchState`, holding JSON:

```
https://hiringcafe.com/?searchState=<url-encoded JSON>&page=<0-based>
```

| `search.*` config | Field in `searchState` | Verified values |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `keywords` | `searchQuery` | free text; accents work. CH baseline 32 540 → `"product manager"` 1 401 |
| `location` | `locations[0]` | see the two shapes below |
| `posted_within` | `dateFetchedPastNDays` | **an enum, not a day count** — table below |
| `remote_only` | `workplaceTypes` | `["Remote"]`. Also `Hybrid`, `Onsite`, `Field` |
| — | `sortBy` | `default` (relevance), `date`, `date_asc`, `compensation_desc` |
| — | `commitmentTypes` | `["Full Time"]`, … |

`posted_within` maps as: `week` → `14`, `month` → `61`, `quarter` → `121` (the
site's own default, so it can be omitted).

| Enum | Window | | Enum | Window |
| --: | :-- | :-- | --: | :-- |
| `-1` | All time | | `29` | Past 3 weeks |
| `2` | Past 24 hours | | `61` | Past month |
| `4` | Past 3 days | | `91` | Past 2 months |
| `14` | Past week | | `121` | Past 3 months (default) |
| `21` | Past 2 weeks | | `750` | Past year |

**The two location shapes, and they are not interchangeable.**

```jsonc
// Country — matched on short_name ONLY. Coordinates are ignored here.
{"formatted_address":"CH","types":["country"],
 "geometry":{"location":{"lat":0,"lon":0}},"id":"user_country",
 "address_components":[{"long_name":"CH","short_name":"CH","types":["country"]}],
 "options":{"flexible_regions":["anywhere_in_continent","anywhere_in_world"]}}

// City — REQUIRES an administrative_area_level_1 component and real coordinates.
{"formatted_address":"Lausanne, CH","types":["locality"],
 "geometry":{"location":{"lat":46.5197,"lon":6.6323}},"id":"lausanne-ch",
 "address_components":[
   {"long_name":"Lausanne","short_name":"Lausanne","types":["locality"]},
   {"long_name":"Vaud","short_name":"Vaud","types":["administrative_area_level_1"]},
   {"long_name":"CH","short_name":"CH","types":["country"]}],
 "options":{"radius":25,"radius_unit":"miles","ignore_radius":false}}
```

Radius, measured live around Lausanne: 6 mi → 993 ads, 25 mi → 2 162,
50 mi → 9 299, 25 km → 1 498, `ignore_radius: true` → 705. Like LinkedIn's
`distance`, this is a net as the crow flies, **not** the commute rule — the
commute filter in `shared/scoring-rubric.md` is what actually discards ads.

## What a card yields

One JSON object per line from `hiringcafe.py search`:

| Field | Use |
| :-- | :-- |
| `id` | the 16-character `requisition_id`. **The ledger key** |
| `ledger_id` | `hiringcafe:<id>`, ready for the pipeline |
| `url` | `https://hiringcafe.com/job/<id>` — see below |
| `title`, `company`, `cities`, `workplace_type`, `commitment`, `seniority` | scoring inputs |
| **`countries`** | **the jurisdictions the employer will hire from — not a workplace.** See below before scoring on it |
| `published_estimate` | HiringCafe's **estimate** of the posting date |
| `ats`, `ats_tenant` | which ATS hosts it, and the employer's tenant on it |
| `apply_url` | the employer's own application URL |
| `collapse_key` | duplicate grouping — the script already dedupes on it |

## The ad id and its URL

The id is `requisition_id`, sixteen alphanumerics. Rebuild the URL from it:

```
https://hiringcafe.com/job/<requisition_id>
```

That answers **308** and redirects to the canonical slug URL. Follow it —
`urllib` needs a handler for 308, which the script installs. **Never build the
slug yourself**: it encodes the title, the company and the city, and a slug that
drifts by one character 404s.

In the ledger the row is `hiringcafe:<requisition_id>`. **Also record
`apply_url`**: it is the employer's own ad, and therefore the one key that
identifies the same posting when it arrives again through another board or
through a future per-ATS adapter. It is the cross-source dedup key the id check
cannot provide.

## Reading one ad

```bash
python3 .../hiringcafe.py ad <requisition_id>
```

Returns the card plus `description` — the employer's full text, converted from
HTML. A gone ad exits **3** with a clear message; record it `discarded`, do not
retry.

## Traps

**1. An unknown field is ignored in silence.** `query`, `q`, `keywords`,
`searchTerm` and `jobTitle` were all accepted and all ignored — the search
returned the *unfiltered* 32 553 ads, not an error. The only keyword field is
`searchQuery`. A typo in a filter name does not fail; it silently widens the
sweep, and the user reads noise as results.

**2. `dateFetchedPastNDays` is an enum, and a wrong value widens the set.**
`=7` returned 41 818 ads against a 32 540 baseline — *more* than no filter at
all. `=2` returned 1 365 and `=14` returned 7 873. Only the table above is
valid; never pass a raw day count.

**3. A city without its region returns 0, not an error.** The same object with
and without the `administrative_area_level_1` component: 2 162 ads versus 0.
Silent zero is this board's characteristic failure — it reads as "no jobs in
your area". The script refuses to build such a search; keep that refusal.

**4. A country code the site does not know returns a small unrelated set.**
`short_name: "ZZ"` returned 124 ads. Not zero, not an error — 124 plausible
looking ads from nowhere in particular.

**5. `company` can be a guess.** `company_attribution: "llm_pick"` means
HiringCafe's model *inferred* the employer from the ad. Treat those names as
provisional: check the `apply_url` host before writing the employer into a
cover letter, and never state an employer to the user on that basis alone.

**6. `published_estimate` is an estimate**, as the field name says — like
jobup's salary estimate. Fine for ordering and for "posted this week"; do not
present it to the user as the employer's publication date.

**7. A card can span several countries.** `cities` is a list, and a Swiss search
legitimately returns an ad listing Chicago, London, Paris *and* Geneva. Score
the location the user could actually work in, and apply the commute rule to
that one.

**8. The same posting appears twice on some ATS.** Observed verbatim: *"Sales
Development Representative"* and *"Copy Of Sales Development Representative"*,
same employer, same `collapse_key`. Dedupe on `collapse_key`, which the script
does.

**9. Cross-board duplicates are guaranteed here, by design.** This board covers
employers that LinkedIn and jobup also carry. The id check cannot see it — run
the employer-name substring check in `skills/job-scan/SKILL.md`, and prefer
`apply_url` when both rows have one.

## Coverage, measured

41 countries sampled on 2026-08-27, one request each, reading `ssrTotalCount`:

| | ads | | | ads |
| :-- | --: | :-- | :-- | --: |
| United States | 3 958 370 | | Switzerland | 32 540 |
| India | 245 616 | | Italy | 31 318 |
| Germany | 232 952 | | Belgium | 24 085 |
| Canada | 213 097 | | Japan | 21 630 |
| United Kingdom | 197 700 | | South Africa | 10 707 |
| France | 130 951 | | Morocco | 3 815 |
| Australia | 87 030 | | Nigeria | 3 178 |
| Netherlands | 58 976 | | Kenya | 2 690 |

**Where it is thin, say so.** In the thinner markets — Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco,
Egypt — roughly half of the first page was remote-from-elsewhere rather than
local. This board is a good default anywhere; it is not a sufficient one
everywhere. In those countries pair it with a national board.

## What it does not cover

**The Swiss ATS are absent.** Across 771 Swiss ads, zero came from Refline,
Ostendis, Umantis or Rexx — the systems that host Swiss SMEs, communes and
clinics. Large employers are well covered (Migros, Swiss Post, the SNB,
Helvetia, Swiss Re, Manor, Lindt & Sprüngli, Siemens, Syngenta, the Canton of
Vaud); small local ones are not. A Swiss user should not read an empty
HiringCafe sweep as an empty market.

## Applying

**There is no in-site apply flow, and that is a feature.** `apply_url` is the
employer's own ATS. Hand the user that URL with their documents, exactly as for
any external ATS. Never attempt the employer's form from here.

## The site throttles by pages asked for, and the sweep now says so

**Measured 2026-09-02 (issue #59), from a Swiss IP:**

| Run | Result |
| :-- | :-- |
| `--country ID --pages 1` | 403, 403, then success on the third attempt |
| **`--country ID --pages 6`** | **8 consecutive attempts, 8 × 403** |
| `--country CH --pages 1` | first try, 30 862 ads |
| `--country FR --pages 1` | first try, 121 503 ads |

All in the same quarter hour, so it is neither a country nor an ISO-code
problem: **the refusal rate tracks how many pages a run asks for.** One page at
a time with 25 s between requests returned **6 pages of 6**.

**So the remedy is waiting, not retrying quickly**, and the adapter now does
three things it did not:

1. **A timed backoff on 403, 429 and 5xx** — four attempts at 20 s, 40 s, 80 s.
   A second-scale retry is useless against this.
2. **`--delay`, default 25 s between pages**, deliberately high. A one-page
   sweep is unaffected; a six-page sweep takes two minutes and works.
3. **A distinct exit code.** `6` means *throttled*: the site refused, and the
   cards already printed are real. `2` still means *broken* — the payload
   shape changed, the search was invalid. They were indistinguishable before,
   and a caller cannot tell a partial pass from a failure without them.

**A truncated sweep never reports a clean finish.** It prints how many pages
of how many were read, says the rest were never fetched, and exits 6:

```
[hiringcafe] THE SWEEP IS PARTIAL: 3 of 6 page(s) read before the site
refused (HTTP 403 after 4 attempts). 118 unique cards were returned and they
are good; the rest were never fetched. Do not report this as a complete pass.
```

That is `shared/never-fail-silently.md` applied in both directions: not a
silent zero, and not a silent success either — the rule is written there as
its point 3b.

**And the pacing works on the case that failed.** Indonesia at `--pages 3`,
the sweep that could not get past three pages of six during the incident,
returned **114 unique cards over 3 pages of 3 asked** with 8 s spacing on
2026-09-02, with no refusal at all.

**Any figure taken from this board must record the pages that came back**, not
the pages that were asked for. A country measured during a throttle rests on a
smaller sample than its wording implies.

## One city, several labels — and the filter that says what it dropped

This board writes the same place several ways inside one result set. Measured
across two countries (issue #65):

| Label | Cards |
| :-- | --: |
| `Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur` | 58 |
| `Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur` | 16 |
| `Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur` | 12 |
| `Hanoi, Hanoi` / `Hanoi, Ha Noi` / **`Hanoi, Hà Nội`** | 19 / 3 / **2** |

Comparing whole strings by equality loses **a fifth to a third of a capital**,
silently. And on Bogotá's 103 cards: whole string 17%, first segment 51%,
**first segment with diacritics folded 100%** — neither condition works alone.

**`--city-filter` applies that comparison to what came back**, which is
different from `--city`, which asks the *site* to search a place. It folds
diacritics, compares the first segment, and **reports what it dropped**:

```
[hiringcafe] --city-filter 'Zurich' kept 2 and dropped 38.
Dropped labels: None ×7, 'Basel, Basel-Stadt, CH' ×4, 'London, England, GB' ×2 …
```

**The two rows it kept were `Zurich, Zurich, CH` and `Zürich, Zurich, CH`** —
the same city with and without the umlaut, on one page of results. An exact
comparison keeps one and loses the other, and says nothing.

The comparison lives in `skills/job-scan/scripts/_locations.py`, shared, not
copied.

## Pace, and one honest note

One request per search page, now spaced by `--delay`. A whole sweep is a few
dozen — keep it that way, sequentially, and it stays indistinguishable from a
person reading.

`robots.txt` disallows `/*?searchState=*` and `/*?page=*`. **Those URLs are not
ours to fetch by the rule, and the collection built on them was suspended from
2026-09-03 — until the decision below.**

## The override — 2026-09-11, the repository's owner, verbatim (#198)

> «&nbsp;Je confirme la dérogation hiringcafe, assigne #198&nbsp;»

Given after being shown three things: that the pilot's local doctrine then
named `api.smartrecruiters.com` as the one exception; that the refusal to lift is a
`Disallow` **written** in the rules, not a refusal at the transport; and that
the realistic cost is HiringCafe blocking the address the requests come from —
**the candidate's, not this project's**. **Unconditional.**

**It lifts BOTH refusals, together.** Until then `_hiringcafe.py` carried the
rule (`SEARCH_RULE`) and, beside it, «&nbsp;collection suspended pending a
decision&nbsp;»; the key sat in a user's `config.yml` with a comment declaring
it inert, and no code read it. A flag that lifted the rule and left the
suspension would look like it acts and act on half — so the decision is cited
in the module, and one key clears both.

**How.** `boards.hiringcafe.override_robots: true` in the user's own
`config.yml`, read by `hiringcafe.py search` through `_override.py` — the same
function `ats.py` uses for SmartRecruiters, each for its own board — bounded
to the search URL on `hiringcafe.com` at the point of the request, announced
once per run where the bypass happens. Absent key: exit 7, the rule, the file
consulted and the sentence to add. `ad` needs none of this and asks the guard
as before. **Onboarding: `shared/setup.md` 5g.**

**What it is not.** It does not follow from `shared/robots-policy.md`'s four
questions — the rule is even-handed and names nobody, which is *obey* — and
neither this card nor the policy dresses it as one. It does not lift the
edge: the host answered 403 to a script on every path on 2026-09-05, and a run
with the key may still come back refused. **And it is the third override in
the plugin, after AMS and SmartRecruiters; ~~a fourth goes to the owner~~ — since 2026-09-13 (#403) the key is the user's on any board refused in writing, and the owner decides no more of them one by one.**

**Three commands were building that URL, not one.** #123 named
`hiringcafe.py:119`, found by reading this file. `ats.py` and `workday.py`
assembled the same `?searchState=` URL with **their own clients** — and
`pinpoint.py` and `recruitee.py` inherit it by running `hiringcafe.py search`
as a subprocess. Two of the five were on the user's path, in `resolve`, which
greenhouse, lever, ashby, workday and join all use. **Grepping for the file
found one; grepping for the URL found three.**

All three go through `skills/job-scan/scripts/_hiringcafe.py` now, and it
**refuses**: it returns the reason instead of the URL, names the rule, names
the open route, and says no request was made. Exit **7**, and the code
survives the subprocess boundary so a refusal reaches the caller as a refusal.

**The verdict is read from the record, not asked afresh.** A guard call is a
request to the host like any other, and collection here is suspended — so
`_hiringcafe.py` carries the verdict measured 2026-09-03 and says that it is
dated. Re-measuring means lifting the suspension first, which is a decision
rather than a code path.

> **Retracted 2026-09-03.** This file previously argued: *"This adapter is not a
> crawler … The project's position is that this is equivalent to browsing."*
> **That position is withdrawn.** It is the argument this repository refuses
> everywhere else — `shared/robots-policy.md`: *the intent behind a directive
> does not change its effect* — and accepting it here, where it happened to
> serve us, was relaxing a rule at the moment it cost something. The
> `Disallow` binds. It is left visible rather than deleted so that no one
> re-derives it.

**There is a permitted door, and it is documented** — see issue #123. `robots.txt`
allows the six sitemaps and `/job/`, and `/job/<slug>` serves the same
`__NEXT_DATA__` as the refused URL plus a `JobPosting` block. So the data is
reachable without touching a disallowed path.

**Two things that route does not solve, and both must be settled before any
rewrite:**

- **The site answers 403 (`cf-mitigated: challenge`) to a scripted client on
  *every* path, including the ones it allows.** A rewrite onto sitemaps will not
  run without the browser fallback of issue #124 — and that fallback must
  trigger on a *fetch failure*, **never on a refusal**: guard `False` or `None`
  means stop, not open a browser. Otherwise the declared identity becomes the
  appearance of compliance rather than compliance.
- **Nothing already published from the refused route can be recomputed by it.**
  Totals exist only in the search response; per-country proportions need a
  country filter the per-ad route does not have. Those figures can be dated,
  not redone.

**Until both are settled: no requests to this host, on any path.** The permitted
route being documented is not a decision to resume.

## Why this adapter does not call the guard — by design, and it is not an omission

`_hiringcafe.py` refuses **from the record**, without asking. The reason is in
that module: **a guard call is a request to the host like any other**, and
collection from this host is suspended. Interrogating the guard in order to
justify not interrogating the host would be circular.

The verdict it carries is dated 2026-09-03 and says so. **Re-measuring means
lifting the suspension first, which is a decision rather than a code path.**

## What is measurable here today, and what is not

**`robots: suspended` was the right word until 2026-09-11; the arbitration
has happened** — see *The override* above — and what remains suspended is
nothing: the rule is crossed on the user's consent, and the edge refuses what
it refuses. The rules are read, they permit four paths, and the edge refused
all four on 2026-09-05. *That key's vocabulary is closed on purpose — a value nothing reads
is an absence with extra steps — so the measurement lives here.*

**Re-read 2026-09-07**: `robots.txt` is byte-identical to the 2026-09-05
reading — 1 158 bytes, md5 `529adb109a6b`. So the rules have not moved.

```
/*?searchState=*        refused in writing to `User-agent: *`
/  /jobs  /job  /recently-posted-jobs      permitted by the rules
                                           HTTP 403, 25 bytes, md5 9ccabba20b9f
```

**Four requests, one per path, guard taken on each.** The plain-HTTP adapter
cannot reach anything: what the file permits, the edge refuses.

**And the two refusals are not the same fact.** `/*?searchState=*` is a rule —
it binds every client, a browser included. The 403 on the other four is
infrastructure, and *nothing measured here says whether it refuses everyone or
refuses us*. `cadremploi.md`, the one board here that uses a browser, answers
403 **to every client including a browser**, which is why
`shared/robots-policy.md` treats it as blocked rather than refused. **That
distinction has not been measured for this host**, and it is the distinction
the policy turns on.

## The browser reaches what plain HTTP cannot, on paths the rules permit — 2026-09-07

**Measured, not reasoned.** `/jobs` renders in a browser and carries a browse
tree; every link under it is `/jobs/<state>`, `/jobs/<city>` or
`/jobs/<title>` — **all permitted, and none of them goes through
`?searchState=`.**

`/jobs/boise-id`, guard taken on that exact path first, carries **real
advertisements**:

```
11 541 jobs at 1 849 companies in Boise, ID     stated by the page
per ad: title · employer · location · workplace type · commitment
        posted age (6h, 1d) · requirements · sometimes a salary band
pagination 1…10          the widget only — nine of those ten are refused
                         in the rules, see *Where it stops* below
```

**So the two refusals really are two different facts, and only one of them
binds here.** `/*?searchState=*` is written in the rules and binds every
client; the 403 on `/jobs` is the edge, and the browser passes it — which is
what `shared/robots-policy.md` records as the ordinary case, **nine sites of
eleven**, with `HTTP 403` first in its *a browser can change the result*
column.

**No anti-robot challenge was presented.** Had one appeared, the run stops and
records it: *this plugin never asks its user to defeat one.*

**What is not established:** whether the `/jobs/<…>` tree reaches the whole
board or a curated slice of it, and whether its per-page totals are the
board's or the filter's. The 11 541 for one city is the page's own claim and
has no second source here.

## The browser route — what to open, and where it stops

**This is a browser route on a board that also has a script.** `hiringcafe.py`
keeps its two commands and both are still correct: `search` refuses because
`/*?searchState=*` is refused **in the rules**, and `ad` is licit but answers
403 to a script. Nothing below changes either. *The rule binds every client;
the 403 does not.*

### The tree, all of it permitted

```
/jobs                     browse index — counts, no advertisements
/jobs/<state>             e.g. /jobs/california
/jobs/<city>              e.g. /jobs/boise-id
/jobs/<title>             e.g. /jobs/data-scientist
/job/<slug>               one advertisement
```

Guard taken on the exact path before each navigation. **None of these goes
through `?searchState=`**, which is the one route that stays closed.

### What a facet page carries, measured 2026-09-07

`/jobs/boise-id` — *11 541 jobs at 1 849 companies*, and `/jobs/data-scientist`
— *4 646 jobs at 1 687 companies*. Per advertisement: title, employer with a
one-line description and ticker where listed, location, workplace type,
commitment, posted age (`6h`, `1d`, `3mo`), a requirements summary, the tools
named, and a salary band on roughly a third.

**`/jobs` itself carries no advertisement.** It is an index of counts, and
counting its links would count facets — the defect `_records.py` exists for,
where 6 932 URLs held no advertisement at all.

### Where it stops — the rules stop it, and my earlier figure was ten times too large

**Twenty advertisements on page one, and page two is refused in the rules.**
Measured 2026-09-07 on `/jobs/boise-id`:

```
page one                   20 advertisements, counted
the rules, verbatim        Disallow: /*?page=*
                           Disallow: /*&page=*
```

**So the licit reach of one facet is 20, not 200.** *I published 200 in this
file this morning — twenty per page times a pagination widget reading 1…10 —
and that is a render bound read as a permitted bound, which is the confusion
this very card warns about one level down, where `_records.py` counts facets
as advertisements.* **The widget shows ten pages; nine of them are refused.**

**And it is refused in the RULES, which is the refusal that binds a browser
too.** Not the edge 403 that a browser passes — a `Disallow` written by hand,
in both the `?` and the `&` form, in a file carrying its author's own comments
(*"Non-canonical duplicates"*, *"Private/admin areas"*). **On this one host the
two refusals have two different authors: the editor decided about pagination,
the vendor decided about us.**

**Correcting a second claim of mine in the same paragraph: the pagination is
links, not buttons.** Its targets read straight off the page, and reading them
is what found the rule that forbids them:

```
label "1"   ->  /jobs/boise-id
label "2"   ->  /jobs/boise-id?page=1      <- zero-indexed
label "10"  ->  /jobs/boise-id?page=9
```

*The label is one ahead of the parameter.* Anyone building `?page=2` for the
second page would have skipped one and reported the third — a trap that is now
moot here, because none of those URLs may be fetched, but the shape is general.

**I wrote that the target could not be read before clicking, and it is printed
in the markup.** The claim came from a screenshot: rendered as chips, the
controls look like buttons. *An appearance was reported as a property.*

### Reach comes from the facet graph, and every page declares it

Depth is closed; breadth is not, and the site publishes its own index of it.
`/jobs/boise-id` carries four tabs — *Top jobs in Boise*, *More Boise job
titles*, *Nearby cities*, *Jobs across Idaho* — and the first alone holds
**43 links**, every one of the form `/jobs/<title>-<city>`:

```
/jobs/warehouse-boise-id   /jobs/rn-boise-id   /jobs/data-engineer-boise-id …
```

**All permitted, all page-one-of-20, and each one names its own neighbours.**
So the route is a graph walk over `/jobs/<facet>`, twenty advertisements a
node, never a descent into pages. *That was already the preferred shape; it is
now the only permitted one.*

**What twenty per node does not give you is a total.** `/jobs/boise-id` claims
11 541 jobs and this route can see twenty of them; facets overlap by
construction — a nurse job in Boise sits under `nurse-boise-id`, `rn-boise-id`,
`healthcare-boise-id` and `boise-id` at once. **Count distinct ad ids, never
sum the nodes.** Two of the twenty on page one share a title and an employer
(*Prep Cook — Broadway Chili's*, six hours and seven hours old) with different
requirement summaries, so even within one node identity needs the id.

### Who refuses the script, and it is not the editor

Recorded 2026-09-07, from the refusal's own provenance:

```
hiringcafe.com   403   25 bytes   md5 9ccabba20b9f…   server: cloudflare
```

**The same refusal body, to the byte, as `www.jobstore.com` and
`www.hays.fr`** — three unrelated operators in three countries — and the header
names the same vendor on all three. *Twenty-five bytes of a standard sentence
would be weak evidence on its own: the shared `robots.txt` fingerprint carried
its weight over 1 836 bytes, where a string that long does not recur by
chance.* **`server: cloudflare` is what turns *the same string* into *the same
vendor*.**

**So this site did not decide to close to us — it bought a service whose
default closes us.** That sentence existed here for rules files; this is it
demonstrated at the transport, on a host whose rules permit the paths its edge
refuses.

### Pace, and the two stops

One page load at a time, at reading speed, in the user's own Chrome — the same
terms as `cadremploi.md`.

**A challenge stops the run.** A captcha, an interstitial or a *prove you are
human* page is reported and the run ends there. **This plugin never asks its
user to defeat one**, and that is not a preference: it is the line that
separates this route from what it would otherwise become.

**A 403 in the browser stops it too.** It would mean the edge refuses a person,
which is a different fact from refusing a script, and it is recorded rather
than retried.

### Why there is no script for this route

The same reason as `cadremploi.md`: every content path answers 403 to a
scripted request. Adding `hiringcafe.py --browser` would be a name for
something that cannot work. **The script keeps the refusal it already has.**
