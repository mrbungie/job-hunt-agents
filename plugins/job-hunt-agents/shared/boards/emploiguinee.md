# Board adapter — EmploiGuinée (Guinea): reopened by the 2026-09-07 doctrine, and the transport answers a challenge

<!-- verified: 2026-09-14 -->

<!-- hosts: www.emploiguinee.com, emploiguinee.com -->
<!-- script: none -->
<!-- countries: GN -->
<!-- content: indeterminate · 1 host, rules read twice and certain — `ClaudeBot` named and refused, `*` open, so `identity()` answers `claude-user` and since #230 `verdict()` sweeps under it — and the root and a listing path answer HTTP 403 to that client on 2 fetches each: 5515 bytes titled «Attention Required! | Cloudflare», md5 `e5ec40ec9ab5` then `546f651c48d4` at constant size — a challenge, nothing of the site was read · 2026-09-12 10:55 UTC -->
<!-- witness: the site's own «57 Offres d'emploi trouvées» on `/recherche-jobs-guinee`, read from a connected tab (no challenge, 2026-09-14 10:04 UTC) — 25 a page, a zero-based pager whose last page `?page=2` carries 7: 25 + 25 + 7 = 57, equal; nothing is served to the declared client (403, the moving «Attention Required!») · 2026-09-14 -->

**Measured 2026-09-12 at 10:55:03Z UTC for #233, lot 2 — a measurement of the
transport, not a decision about the host.** Every fetch under the declared
identity, the guard on the exact path first, by `bin/fetch-body.py
--allow-refusal` — the four records carry the status, the bytes, the md5 and
the `cf-ray` that answered.

## The rules — reopened by the doctrine of 2026-09-07 and by #230

```
robots.txt      read twice, certain: True, 1836 B, md5 c6370d4bc025 both times — `User-agent: ClaudeBot / Disallow: /`, `*` open
identity("/")   http, claude-user      <- the group naming ClaudeBot does not bind Claude-User (owner, 2026-09-07)
verdict()       sweep True, sweep_token claude-user   <- since #230 (2026-09-11)
allowed("/")    True
```

*The file is Cloudflare's managed content block, byte for byte — the
`Content-Signal` preamble and nine named crawlers refused, `ClaudeBot` among
them — with not one line of the operator's own.* Before the decision this
host was read as closed by name; the decision reopened it on paper, and this
card is the first time its transport was asked under the permitted token.

## The transport — a Cloudflare challenge

```
GET https://www.emploiguinee.com/                           403, 5515 B, md5 e5ec40ec9ab5    (10:55:03Z)
GET https://www.emploiguinee.com/                           403, 5515 B, md5 546f651c48d4    (second fetch)
GET https://www.emploiguinee.com/recherche-jobs-guinee     403, 5515 B, md5 1516d8bda150    (10:56:02Z)
GET https://www.emploiguinee.com/recherche-jobs-guinee     403, 5515 B, md5 c90073d3b0ac    (second fetch)
```

**Same size, different md5 on two fetches of the same URL, «Attention
Required! | Cloudflare» — a challenge**, the `revolico` / `mabumbe` /
`sudancareers` family. *Masking the 16-hex `cf-ray` in the two bodies leaves
one difference, a base64 timestamp in `__CF$cv$params` — the whole of the
movement is the edge's own stamp.* *The comparison across hosts is void (the
`cf-ray` is in the body); the comparison of one URL with itself is what says
«challenge».* **A challenge is where the browser branch stops** (borne 2): the
plugin neither defeats one nor asks the user to. Whether a real browser passes
it without a person is not measured, and this card claims nothing either way.

## What this card is, and is not

- **Not a verdict that the host is closed** — the owner's decision, on his
  express validation (rule of 2026-09-08). Recorded: one client, one day, two
  fetches each of the root and a listing path, a challenge.
- **No script, no configuration.** A user with a URL from this host can hand
  it to `cover-letter`; whether that page is served to a browser is not
  established here.
- **AfricaWork franchise**: the same rules file (1836 B, md5 `c6370d4bc025`) as
  `www.emploibenin.com`, `www.emploi.cm`, `www.emploisenegal.com` and the
  other members of lot 1 — **this is one read of this host, dated, not a
  verdict copied from a sibling**: two members of this very lot answer a
  challenge where the other five answer the static default, under one and the
  same rules file.

## 2026-09-14 10:04–10:06 UTC — no challenge to a connected tab

```
tab, /recherche-jobs-guinee          served — «57 Offres d'emploi trouvées», 25 cards /offre-emploi-guinee/<slug>-<id>, pager ?page=1, 2 (zero-based)
tab, /recherche-jobs-guinee?page=2   served — 7 cards, the last: 25 + 25 + 7 = 57, equal to the statement
```

**`route: browser · 57 · 2026-09-14`** — the AfricaWork procedure from a
tab (`africawork.py`'s walk driven from the tab: the zero-based pager, the
id from the address tail, the page's count beside the walk, the repaired
JobPosting). The declared client still gets the moving «Attention
Required!» (2026-09-12) — never defeated; the tab was not challenged.
