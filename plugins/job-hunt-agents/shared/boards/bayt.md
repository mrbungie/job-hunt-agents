The largest job site in the Middle East and North Africa. **No adapter, and
the reason is a layer, not a policy.**

## Three answers, from three different layers

**`robots.txt` permits the country paths and refuses the generic search.**
Checked per path, which is the only way to see it:

```
True   /en/saudi-arabia/jobs/            (country listing)
True   /en/saudi-arabia/jobs/?page=2     (its pagination)
True   /en/uae/jobs/
False  /en/jobs/?page=2                  Disallow: /en/jobs/?
False  /en/jobs/engineering-jobs/        Disallow: /en/jobs/*-jobs/
```

The refusals are the **generic** search and the category landings, in all
three languages; the country listings are open. A host-level check says
`sweep: True` and tells you nothing about either.

**Cloudflare refuses every scripted request.** 403 with a 5 507-byte
*"Attention Required!"* interstitial on `/`, on `/en/jobs/`, on
`/en/uae/jobs/`, and on `/sitemap.xml` — with ordinary browser headers.
`robots.txt` itself is served normally, which is how the two layers are told
apart: **the rules are readable and the site is not.**

**The browser reads it in full.** `/en/saudi-arabia/jobs/` renders 30
advertisements with title, employer, city, salary band, seniority, experience
and posting age. **So this is a bot wall, not a refusal** — and the two must
not be recorded as the same thing. `shared/robots-policy.md` is the file that
governs consent; this is not a consent question.

## Three different totals on one page, and they do not agree

Read 2026-09-03 on `/en/saudi-arabia/jobs/`:

| where on the page | Saudi Arabia | Riyadh | Jeddah | Qatif |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| header | **5.8K jobs found** | | | |
| SEO prose, foot of page | **6 876** | 1 703 | 345 | 210 |
| sidebar facet counts | | **1 664** | **332** | **153** |

**Every pair disagrees.** The header and the prose differ by about a thousand;
the prose and the facets differ city by city, by 39, 13 and 57. The date facet
adds a fourth: *Past 30 days (2 857)* against a total of 5 800.

**Whichever number a person quotes, the page contains at least two that
contradict it.** This is the shape this repository keeps meeting — *a board's
reported total is not a count* — with the unusual courtesy of publishing the
contradiction in one view. **Anyone writing an adapter here must count rows.**

## Why there is no adapter

Not consent, and not shape. **The site is unreachable from a script and
readable in the browser**, so any read happens in the user's own session — the
same conclusion `shared/robots-policy.md` records for other walled hosts.
There is no scripted route to build on, and building one that pretends
otherwise would produce a Cloudflare interstitial parsed as a board.

**The check that separates the layers is one request**: fetch `robots.txt`
and one page. If the first is served and the second is a 5 507-byte
interstitial, the wall is Cloudflare's and the rules have said nothing.


## 2026-09-13 — the browser route, MEASURED (#222): three figures on one listing, and a challenge the tab passed without a click

```
declared client   GET /en/uae/jobs/     403, 5 695 B, cloudflare — twice, md5 f966d2… then a2f1cd…: a MOVING body, family (3) of robots-policy.md (a challenge page)
tab               /en/uae/jobs/         200 «Jobs in UAE (Sep 2026) - Bayt.com» — no visible challenge, no click asked
                  header «13.6K jobs found» · prose «Bayt.com currently has 8378 jobs openings … 3966 jobs in Dubai, 1661 jobs in Abu Dhabi, 185 jobs in Al Ain»
                  30 /en/uae/jobs/<slug>-<id>/ cards · JSON-LD ItemList · pager ?page=2 … 333  (333 × 30 = 9 990)
```

**The tab was served; the client meets a challenge page that the tab
cleared by itself** — «a passive interstitial is re-read; a challenge
that asks for a click is a stop» (`robots-policy.md`), and nothing asked
for a click. **Three counts on one page**: 13.6K in the header, 8 378 in
the prose, ≤ 9 990 by the pager — the adapter prints the header's figure
as the site's and the other two beside it, never one corrected into
another. The procedure: guard → tab → read the header → `?page=1 … 333`
1.5 s apart collecting `/en/uae/jobs/<slug>-<id>/` → «n emitted, site
states 13.6K (header) / 8 378 (prose)» → close. *One page read.*
