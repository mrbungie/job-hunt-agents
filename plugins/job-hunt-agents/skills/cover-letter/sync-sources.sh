------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to produce the exports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The whole profile — one click:
   open your LinkedIn profile → the "More" button under your header
   → "Save to PDF". It lands in your Downloads folder.

2. The four detail pages — open each URL, then print it to PDF
   (Cmd/Ctrl + P → Destination: Save as PDF), keeping the suggested name:

     https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your-handle>/details/experience/
     https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your-handle>/details/projects/
     https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your-handle>/details/certifications/
     https://www.linkedin.com/in/<your-handle>/details/skills/

   SCROLL EACH PAGE TO THE BOTTOM BEFORE PRINTING. They load more entries as
   you scroll; printing early silently truncates your history, and the resume
   that follows will simply be missing jobs.

Then re-run this script. Files already collected are left alone unless a newer
export is found.

Missing detail pages are workable — the skills continue with a smaller record.
A missing Profile.pdf is not: it is the backbone of the factual record.
