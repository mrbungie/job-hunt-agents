"""Read the HR.ge platform — six Georgian brands on one API, and only four of
them have any ads.

**No key, no cookie, no browser.** Every brand's `robots.txt` is 109 bytes,
`Allow: /`, and declares a sitemap **on the platform's API host**:

    Sitemap: https://api.p.hr.ge/public-portal/tenant/<n>/api/v3/seo/sitemap

**The tenant number in that line is the whole discovery.** It names the
platform, and the ad page names the rest: `tenant/1`, `/2`, `/4`, `/5` appear
in one ad's own markup.

MEASURED 2026-09-03 — six tenants, and `7` upward answer `500`:

    tenant  host              <loc>    announcements
      1     www.hr.ge        39 247        1 062
      2     www.cv.ge        39 247        1 062
      3     www.career.ge    38 185            0
      4     www.doctor.ge    38 249           64
      5     www.chefs.ge     38 345          160
      6     www.bankers.ge   38 185            0

**Three corrections to what this repository recorded, all in the same
direction — the sitemap is not the ad count:**

- **1 062 ads, not 39 247.** Of tenant 1's `<loc>` elements, **36 593 are
  `/customer/` employer pages** and 1 505 are search landing pages. Counting
  the file reports a board thirty-seven times its size — the arithmetic that
  would have inflated Jobstore and Vieclam24h.
- **`career.ge` has no ads at all**, and it was recorded here as sharing
  hr.ge's corpus. **It does share it — because its own `robots.txt` declares
  `tenant/1`, which is hr.ge's sitemap, while career.ge is tenant 3.** A brand
  pointing at another brand's file, and a conclusion drawn from the file
  rather than from the brand.
- **`doctor.ge` and `chefs.ge` were not known here** — vertical boards,
  medical and culinary, 64 and 160 ads.

`hr.ge` and `cv.ge` are genuinely one corpus: **identical `<loc>` counts and
identical byte counts, 5 377 511**, differing only in the host they name.

THE LISTING COUNTS LINKS, NOT ADS. `/jobs/today?p=<n>` returns **100 links a
page over 8 pages — 800 links, 281 distinct ads. A factor of 2.85**, and
**page 4 added zero new ones** while answering with a full hundred. A sweep
that counts what it fetched reports three times the board. This file
deduplicates and prints both numbers, because only their difference exposes
the padding.

**The end of the listing is honest**, which is worth saying next to
`encuentra24.md`: page 50 returns **0 ads**, not page 1 again.

THE PAYLOAD CARRIES CONTACT DETAILS THE AD ITSELF ASKS TO HIDE. On the
measured ad, **`hideContactPerson: true`** — and `contactName`,
`contactEmail` and `contactMobilePhoneNumber` are all populated. **So the
allow-list here is not tidiness, it is the publisher's own instruction**: 150
keys, of which about forty are Google Ads slot configuration, and `KEEP` names
the eighteen a ledger has any use for.

**And `similarAnnouncements` embeds other ads inside an ad.** A reader that
harvests every `announcementId` in the payload collects the neighbours — the
LinkedIn suggestion-block trap, in JSON.

THE SEARCH ENDPOINT EXISTS AND ITS REQUEST SHAPE IS NOT ESTABLISHED.
`POST …/api/v3/announcement-search` answers `500` — *"Attempted to divide by
zero"* — to `{"page","pageSize"}`, `{"pageNumber","pageSize"}`,
`{"page","size"}` and `{"paging":{…}}` alike, **all four with an identical
279-byte body**, which is agreement produced by nothing having parsed. Guessing
further would be #72's fault; the listing works and is used instead.

Verified against the live platform on **2026-09-03**.
