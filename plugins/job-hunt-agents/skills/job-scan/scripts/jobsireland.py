"""Fetch Irish ads from JobsIreland — the state board, where half the ads
are not jobs.

**4 934 live ads** from Ireland's public employment service, run by the
Department of Social Protection. The fifth national public employment service
here after `job-room.md` (CH), `france-travail.md` (FR), `empleate.md` (ES) and
`arbeitsagentur.md` (DE), and **the first Irish adapter**.

  GET /robots.txt                                  → three lines, no Disallow
  GET /Jobsireland.API/JobsIreland/BrowseJobs      → the ads, as an HTML fragment
       ?page=1&pageSize=100&location=&keyWord=
  GET /en-US/job-Details?id=<id>                   → the ad, for a human

**No browser, no account, no key.** `robots.txt` is a `User-agent: *` with
**no `Disallow` line at all** and a sitemap — the most permissive file in this
repository. No crawler and no AI agent is named.

The parameter names are not guessed: they are read out of the page's own
`$.ajax` call, which passes `keyWord`, `location`, `page`, `pageSize`,
`CareerlevelId`, `VacancyTypeId`, `ContractTypeId`, `NaceCode` and
`RemoteOrBlendedJobType`.

HALF THIS BOARD IS NOT ORDINARY EMPLOYMENT, AND NOTHING SAYS SO. Across the
250 newest ads:

    #JOB   position-box   106   ordinary paid jobs
    #CES   scheme-box     135   Community Employment Scheme
    #WPEP  yess-box         9   Work Placement Experience Programme

**And the mix moves with the page.** The board is sorted newest first, and
across `pageSize=100` pages the ordinary-job share ran 58, 33, 33, 48, 0 and 0
percent on pages 1, 2, 5, 20, 45 and 49 — page 45 was 99 scheme rows out of
100. So a shallow sweep over-samples real jobs and a deep one under-samples
them. Neither number is the board.

**CES is a state work-placement scheme** — part-time supervised placement for
long-term unemployed people, paid on a social-welfare rate, entered through an
Intreo office rather than by applying to an employer. It is a majority of the
board, and a candidate searching for a job needs to be told which of the three
they are looking at. `offer_kind` carries it on every card, and every run
prints the split.

THE TRAP THAT OUTLIVES THE BOARD: **the card's CSS class changes with the ad
type, so splitting on the class you see first silently selects one
population.**

    <div class="job-heading scheme-box"    …>   135
    <div class="job-heading position-box"  …>   106
    <div class="job-heading yess-box"      …>     9
    <div class="job-heading #boxclass"     …>     1

Split on `job-heading scheme-box` — the first variant that appears in the
response — and you get **136 of 251 cards, of which 135 are CES**. Not a
truncation you would notice: a full-looking result set, correctly parsed, from
which you would conclude that Ireland's public board is nothing but placement
schemes. The anchor here is `job-heading `, the common prefix, and the parse is
checked against the raw count of ad links in the same document.

AND SOME RESPONSES CARRY A TEMPLATE ROW. The fourth class, `#boxclass`, is an
uninterpolated template whose fields are the literal strings `#JobReference`,
`#StartDate`, `#EndDate`, `#VacancyTypeId`.

**It is intermittent** — present on pages 5, 20 and 45 of a `pageSize=100`
sweep and absent from pages 1, 2 and 49, so a page returns 100 cards or 101.
Emitted unfiltered it becomes an ad published on `#StartDate`, and a
spot-check of the first page would never see it. Same species as the
`#{company.slug}` template another session measured on trampos.co — a
placeholder that reached production and reads as data — with the intermittence
of the `Content-Encoding` flap on `infoempleo.md`.

Every field starting with `#` is refused, so the row is dropped whether or not
its class gives it away.

Usage:
  jobsireland.py count --location Dublin
  jobsireland.py search --location Dublin --limit 40
  jobsireland.py search --keyword developer --kind job

Output: one JSON object per line.
