"""Fetch job cards and ad text from hiringcafe.com.

HiringCafe is a meta-board: it crawls employer career pages across ~40 ATS
platforms. Every card names the employer and links to that employer's own ATS,
so results are NOT aggregator reposts — see shared/boards/hiringcafe.md.

The site's own /api/search-jobs endpoint returns 401. This script reads the
server-rendered payload embedded in the page instead (__NEXT_DATA__), which
needs no key, no cookie and no browser.

Usage:
  hiringcafe.py search --country CH [--query "..."] [--posted-within week]
                       [--remote] [--sort date] [--pages 3]
  hiringcafe.py search --city Lausanne --admin1 Vaud --country CH \\
                       --lat 46.5197 --lon 6.6323 [--radius 25]
  hiringcafe.py ad <requisition_id>

Output: one JSON object per line (search), or one JSON object (ad).
Every failure is loud: a search that cannot be built exits non-zero rather
than returning an unfiltered or empty result set that looks like an answer.
