"""Fetch Trinidad and Tobago's national vacancies from EmployTT — where a
missing advertisement answers **200 with the listing page**.

The Ministry of Labour's national employment service. **No key, no cookie, no
browser, and no endpoint**: every advertisement is in the served HTML of one
page, and `robots.txt` is 26 bytes that close nothing.

  GET /jobs/list        → 200 text/html; every live advertisement, in the
                          markup. jPList paginates in the browser, so the
                          "10 per page" control is not a server limit
  GET /jobs/view/<id>   → one advertisement

**AN ID THAT DOES NOT EXIST IS NOT AN ERROR HERE.** Measured 2026-09-03:
`/jobs/view/2604`, `2606`, `2609`, `2617`, `2632`, `2500` and `2000` all
answer **HTTP 200 with 175 396 bytes — byte for byte the listing page.** No
redirect status, no 404, nothing in the body that announces itself as a
substitution.

**So the status code cannot be the check.** A real advertisement page carries
**zero** `/jobs/view/` links; the listing carries one per advertisement, and
its `<h1>` reads *Jobs Listing* rather than a job title. `ad` tests that and
exits 3 rather than emitting a card built from the listing — which would have
carried the *first* advertisement's title under the id that was asked for.

THE FILTER LINKS ARE CLIENT-SIDE, AND THEY ALL RETURN THE SAME PAGE.
`/jobs/list/category-cbx-1`, `/jobs/list/city-cbx-PortofSpain` and
`/jobs/list/employmentStatus-cbx-fulltime` each returned **the same 21
advertisements** as `/jobs/list`. Two readings fit that — *the server sends
everything and jPList filters it*, or *the path segment is ignored* — and
**they are indistinguishable from the counts alone**, so this script does not
paginate or filter by URL. One request is the sweep.

**LISTING MEMBERSHIP TRACKS NEITHER EXPIRY NOR RECENCY.** Measured
2026-09-03, and each step corrected the one before it.

`/jobs/view/2618` renders a complete advertisement — *Driver/Messenger*,
Barataria — and is **absent from the listing**. The first reading was that the
listing is the unexpired set. The advertisement pages carry an `Expires:`
field, and it refutes that:

    /jobs/view/2603   Expires: 03 September 2026   listed
    /jobs/view/2618   Expires: 04 September 2026   NOT listed

**The one expiring today is listed; the one expiring tomorrow is not.** And
the listing itself carries the other half of the contradiction: **two of its
twenty-one advertisements expired on 02 September** — `2607` and `2615` — and
were still being served on the third. Those two, and only those two, print no
"expires <date>" sentence on their card, which is how the board itself marks a
deadline already past. **Two expired advertisements in, one unexpired
advertisement out.**

Scanning ids 2590-2640: **22 render an advertisement** — the listing's 21 plus
2618 — and the other 29 answer with the listing page. There is no archive
either; ids below the live range are gone rather than kept.

**Nothing visible from outside explains which of the twenty-two is listed.**
`search` returns what the listing serves and says so; **it does not claim to be
the board**, and the count it prints is the listing's, not a total. *A listing
that looks complete* is what this repository keeps finding, and here the gap
is small, real and unexplained rather than argued away.

THE DESCRIPTION IS ESCAPED TWICE. The stored field is HTML and the template
escapes it again, so the page literally contains `&lt;div&gt;` and `&#47;`.
`--with-text` unescapes twice and then strips tags; unescaping once leaves
markup as visible text in the ledger.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
