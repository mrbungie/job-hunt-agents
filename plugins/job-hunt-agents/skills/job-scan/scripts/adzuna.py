"""Fetch ads from Adzuna — nineteen countries on one key, and 250 calls a day.

Adzuna aggregates job ads in nineteen countries and publishes a single REST
API where the country is a path segment, so one adapter reaches Switzerland,
France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, the
UK, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, South Africa,
Brazil and Mexico.

  GET https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/<country>/search/<page>
      ?app_id=…&app_key=…&results_per_page=50&what=…&where=…
  GET https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/<country>/ad/<adref>
      → undocumented, and it answers — see below

THE BUDGET IS THE DESIGN. The published limits are **25 calls a minute, 250 a
day, 1 000 a week and 2 500 a month**, for everything together. Fifty ads a
call is the ceiling, so a day's budget is 12 500 ads across every country and
every search. **Sweeping nineteen countries does not fit**, and neither does
paging deep on one. This script asks for `results_per_page=50` always, reads
one page per search by default, and refuses to exceed `--max-calls` in a
single run so a loop cannot spend the day's allowance.

`results_per_page` **caps at 50 silently**: 100 and 101 both answer 200 with
50 rows and no complaint. Code that asks for 100 and assumes it got 100 will
page twice as often as it thinks.

THE DESCRIPTION IS A 500-CHARACTER TEASER, and the spec says so — *"truncated
to 500 characters"*. Measured: the median and the maximum are both exactly
500, on every country sampled. **This is a discovery board, not a scoring
board.** The full text lives with the advertiser, behind `redirect_url`, which
is also the link Adzuna's terms require you to send people to.

THE SALARY MAY BE ADZUNA'S GUESS. `salary_is_predicted == '1'` means the
figure came from their Jobsworth estimator, not from the advert. On 50 GB ads:
16 carried a salary, **6 of them predicted**, 10 real. So this script never
emits a field called `salary_min`. It emits **`salary_min_stated`** — the
advertiser's, or nothing — and **`salary_min_adzuna_estimate`** separately.
A number the board invented must not be able to look like a number the
employer wrote.

Everything here was verified against the live API on **2026-09-02** with the
user's own key.
