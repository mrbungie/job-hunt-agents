"""Read one employer's board from Pinpoint — two endpoints, two entities, two
id spaces.

Pinpoint is a UK-origin ATS. Each tenant publishes its board as public JSON,
with no key and no browser:

  GET https://<tenant>.pinpointhq.com/postings.json   → the publications
  GET https://<tenant>.pinpointhq.com/jobs.json       → the requisitions
  https://<tenant>.pinpointhq.com/en/postings/<uuid>  → the ad, for a human

**Measured on 684 postings across five tenants on 2026-09-01.**

`robots.txt` closes `/mydata`, `/admin` and `/companies`; neither JSON path is
disallowed and no crawler or AI agent is named. *(`/api/v1/jobs` also exists
and answers `401 — X-API-KEY header not provided`. That is the tenant's own
admin API and it is not this adapter's door.)*

THE TRAP THAT OUTLIVES THE BOARD: **the two endpoints are two different
things, and their ids never overlap.**

    menzies    52 postings    43 jobs     0 ids in common
    davies    276 postings   251 jobs     0 ids in common
    nfamily   281 postings   281 jobs     1 id  in common

A `posting` is a *publication*; a `job` is the *requisition* behind it. Each
posting carries `job.id`, and all 52 of menzies' resolve into `jobs.json`.
**Fifteen jobs across the five tenants carry more than one posting, one of them
seven.** So the two counts differ — and on `nfamilyclub` they are *equal*
while still being disjoint, which is the case that would convince someone the
endpoints are two views of one list.

They are not. A ledger keyed on `jobs.json` ids and an ad URL built from
`postings.json` describe different objects, and nothing in either response says
so. **This adapter reads `postings.json`**, because a candidate applies to a
posting: the URL, the location and the compensation all hang off it.

*(There are three identifiers per ad, which is one more than it looks. `id` is
numeric — `389422`. The public URL carries a **UUID** —
`/en/postings/68f11550-…`. And `job.id` is a fourth number belonging to the
requisition. All three are emitted; the numeric posting id is the ledger key.)*

`province` IS NOT A PROVINCE. Across 684 postings the field holds, verbatim:

    London 149 · United Kingdom 96 · Maharashtra 68 · Bolton 44 ·
    England 38 · Surrey 32 · uk

A city, a country, an Indian state, a town, a nation, a county, and a lowercase
country code — in one field, across five tenants. It is `hays-fr.md`'s
`addressLocality == addressRegion` problem with the levels mixed as well as the
granularity. It is emitted as `province_freetext` and is never a key; `city`
(680 of 684) and `postal_code` (548) are the fields that mean what they say.

WHERE THIS BOARD GETS IT RIGHT, and it is worth recording because so few do:

- **`compensation_visible` actually tracks the figure.** True on 337 of 684,
  a figure on 333, and only **4** visible-with-no-amount. `turijobs.md` has 27
  visible and 2 figures; `platsbanken.md` states the pay *type* on 300 of 300
  and the amount on none. Here the flag means what it says.
- **`workplace_type` is a real three-value enum** — onsite 366, hybrid 259,
  remote 59 — where `recruitee.md` has three overlapping booleans and
  `empleate.md` has one constant.

FINDING TENANTS, AND A LESSON ABOUT DOING IT BY URL. There is no directory.
`pinpoint.py tenants --country GB` reads HiringCafe's cards — but through the
`ats` / `ats_tenant` fields the HiringCafe adapter already extracts, **not** by
matching `pinpointhq.com` in the apply URL.

The difference is not cosmetic: on one draw of 120 cards the URL pattern found
**5** tenants and `ats_tenant` found **23**. Some Pinpoint tenants serve their
board on their own domain, so the apply URL never says `pinpointhq` —
`mountainwarehouse` (187 postings), `breedongroup` (97) and `blackpooltransport`
(3) are all real boards a URL matcher misses. **Re-deriving what an upstream
adapter already labelled is how you under-count a family by four fifths.**

Usage:
  pinpoint.py jobs --tenant menzies
  pinpoint.py jobs --tenant davies --paid-only
  pinpoint.py tenants --country GB

Output: one JSON object per line.
