"""Decode a response with the charset it declares, not the one we assume.

**`decode("utf-8", "replace")` is this repository's house pattern — 32 of its
adapters use it — and on a Latin-1 site it corrupts every accented character
without failing.** That is the shape `shared/plausible-and-false.md` catalogues,
arriving in the transport layer: **`errors="replace"` cannot raise, so it
produces plausible text with holes in it.**

MEASURED ON `bne.gob.cl`, Chile's national employment service, 2026-09-03:

    Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1
    <meta charset="windows-1252">
    bytes: b'Pudahuel \xa1Comisiones'

    decoded as utf-8    →  "Pudahuel �Comisiones"
    decoded as cp1252   →  "Pudahuel ¡Comisiones"

**Eight of eight sampled ads lost between 37 and 93 characters** under UTF-8,
and none under cp1252. On a Spanish-language board that is most of the text
that carries meaning.

**And the site declares its encoding twice, differently** — `ISO-8859-1` in the
header, `windows-1252` in the markup. They agree on these bytes and they are
not the same declaration; **neither is UTF-8**, which is the only thing a
reader needed to notice.

WHAT THIS DOES, IN ORDER:

1. The HTTP header's charset, when the server states one.
2. A `<meta charset>` or `<meta http-equiv>` in the first 2 kB, when it does
   not — the markup's own claim. **An XML prolog counts as markup too**:
   `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>` is how a sitemap declares
   itself, and this repository reads sitemaps on almost every board.
3. UTF-8, **strictly**, which either succeeds or tells us it is not UTF-8.
4. cp1252 as the last resort, because it maps every byte and therefore never
   raises: **the fallback is chosen for being total, not for being right**, and
   the caller is told which one was used.
