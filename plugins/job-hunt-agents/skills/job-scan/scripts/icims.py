"""Read one employer's iCIMS careers site — where the default URL is not the ad.

iCIMS is an ATS: one employer per site, no search across employers. It earns
an adapter because four country surveys named it as the most common family
with no adapter here — Ireland 10 cards of 240, Singapore 15 of 240,
Philippines 12 of 240, Indonesia 5 of 120 — and one ATS family serves every
country at once.

  GET https://<host>/robots.txt            → read it. Per HOST, never per family
  GET https://<host>/sitemap.xml           → this employer's ads, one <loc> each
  GET https://<host>/jobs/<id>/<slug>/job?in_iframe=1
                                           → **the ad**
  GET https://<host>/jobs/<id>/<slug>/job  → 90 KB of the employer's portal,
                                             HTTP 200, and no ad in it

THE DEFAULT URL IS NOT THE AD, AND THE SITEMAP LISTS THE DEFAULT ONE. Measured
2026-09-02 on `careers-sunrise.icims.com/jobs/8179/nurse/job`:

    without ?in_iframe=1 → 200, 90 117 bytes, no JobPosting, no job title
    with    ?in_iframe=1 → 200, 37 509 bytes, JobPosting, "Nurse", 4 637 chars

**So this is an instruction and not a warning: append `?in_iframe=1` to every
URL the sitemap gives you.** Enumerate 14 000 ads the obvious way and you
collect 14 000 plausible pages containing nothing, in HTTP 200, and conclude
the board is empty.

THE SAME ID IS A DIFFERENT VACANCY ON EVERY HOST, AND THE WRONG HOST ANSWERS
200. `/jobs/8179` is a nurse at Sunrise and something else entirely at MV
Transportation; the shared `careers.icims.com` 404s it. So the ledger key is
`icims:<host>:<id>` and the host is not optional. This is the mirror of the
Workday defect found the same day: there, one vacancy under two keys, which
duplicates; here, two vacancies under one key, which **makes an ad disappear**.

THREE HOST SHAPES, AND THE PLATFORM HOST IS NEVER CONSTRUCTED. `careers-<t>`,
`<t>` bare, and the employer's own domain — `careers.montenidoaffiliates.com`,
`jobs.lutheranseniorlife.org`. A branded page names its platform host in its
own markup, so `resolve` reads it rather than guessing: the prefix has been
seen as `careers-`, `apply-`, `field-` and nothing at all, and a constructed
host 404s while the employer looks like it has no vacancies.

ROBOTS IS READ PER HOST. Two of six iCIMS hosts sampled served
`User-agent: * / Disallow: /`. Three rules, in order:

1. **The host given governs.** Its file is read and its answer is obeyed.
2. **No host is ever substituted to escape a refusal.** If the host given
   refuses, that is the answer — `resolve` does not become a way around it.
3. **If a sibling host refuses while the given host permits, say so**, and
   leave the decision with the person. Not silence in either direction.

Verified against the live platform on **2026-09-02**.
