"""Fetch Indonesian and Philippine ads from Kalibrr — where an empty search
answers with somebody else's results.

Kalibrr is South-East Asia's private board, and one adapter serves **two
countries**: 1 116 Indonesian and 777 Philippine ads on 2026-09-08
(1 045 and 778 on 2026-09-02 — the Indonesian stock grew, see the card). Public
JSON, **no key, no cookie, no browser**. `robots.txt` is 59 bytes of
`text/plain` and closes two paths, neither of them a job.

  GET /kjs/job_board/search?country=Indonesia&limit=100&offset=0
      → 200 {"jobs":[…], "count":1045, "from_alternative":false, …}
  https://www.kalibrr.com/c/<company-code>/jobs/<id>
      → the ad, server-rendered; the slug is optional

A SEARCH THAT MATCHES NOTHING IS ANSWERED WITH A SUBSTITUTE SET, AND THE ONLY
SIGN IS ONE BOOLEAN:

    ?country=Indonesia    → count 1045, from_alternative false
    ?country=Philippines  → count  778, from_alternative false
    ?country=Singapore    → count  818, from_alternative TRUE
    ?text=zzzzqqqq        → count  818, from_alternative TRUE
    (no country at all)   → count  818, from_alternative false

Kalibrr does not operate in Singapore and has no ad matching `zzzzqqqq`. Both
return **the same 818 ads, headed by the same employer**, with a full payload
and HTTP 200. Nothing else in the response differs.

Note the last line: **the unfiltered call returns that same 818 and is smaller
than either country on its own.** The default is not "everything" — it is the
fallback set. A sweep with no country reads a curated remainder and calls it
the board.

So `--country` is required here, and **any response carrying
`from_alternative` is refused rather than scored**.

THE SALARY IS CONVERTED TO PHILIPPINE PESOS AND THE LABEL DOES NOT SAY SO.
Every salaried ad on this endpoint carries `salary_currency: "PHP"` —
including the Indonesian ones, whose amounts arrive as
`22962.742977478316`, a rupiah figure converted at some rate. The sibling
endpoint `/api/job_board/search` keeps the two fields this one dropped:
`salary_currency_orig: "IDR"` and `converted_salary: true`.

**CORRECTED 2026-09-08: `/kjs` now carries both fields.** Measured through the
browser route on 50 Indonesian ads — 14 carry a salary and **14 of 14 read
`salary_currency: "PHP"`, `salary_currency_orig: "IDR"`, `converted_salary:
true`**, at `salary_interval: "month"`. *Either the endpoint gained them since
2026-09-02 or the first reading missed them; nothing measured says which.*
**The conduct below does not change** — emitting `salary_php_*` and never
`salary_min` is right either way — but the REASON stated above ("this one
drops") is no longer true of the endpoint.

Read an Indonesian `base_salary` as pesos and you are wrong by a factor of
about 250. **This adapter therefore never emits `salary_min`.** It emits
`salary_php_min`, `salary_php_max` and `salary_converted`, so nothing
downstream can mistake a converted figure for the employer's.

Everything here was verified against the live service on **2026-09-02**.
