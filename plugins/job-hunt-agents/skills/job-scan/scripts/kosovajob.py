"""KosovaJob (`kosovajob.com`) — Kosovo's second board, and the larger one.

  kosovajob.py list [--expiring-before 2026-10-01] [--city Prishtinë] [--limit 20]
  kosovajob.py ad --employer sonnecto --slug call-agent-deutsch

**566 advertisements from one request**, server-rendered, no sitemap declared
and none composed. `ofertapune.py` gives 481 from the same country the same
day; **148 of them are on both**, so the two together are not 1 047.

IT SHARES OFERTAPUNE'S TEMPLATE AND NOT ITS DATABASE

Both hosts serve `jobListCnts` / `jobListCntsInner` / `jobListTitle date=` /
`jobListCity` / `jobListExpires`, and the same advertisement leads both
homepages. **But the ids differ**: Sonnecto's *Call Agent (Deutsch)* is
`109849` on ofertapune and `47268` here. *A shared template names a supplier,
not an operator* — and two different id spaces carrying the same vacancy is an
employer posting twice, not one board wearing two names.

THE OVERLAP, AND WHY IT IS 148 AND NOT A RATE

Both boards' listing URLs end in a title-derived slug, so the slug is the only
key on offer. **It is an identifier on one board and not on the other**: 481
advertisements carry 481 distinct slugs on ofertapune, while 566 here carry
516 — `recepsioniste` is worn by six different vacancies and
`kamariere-shankiste` by six more.

So the intersection was confirmed against a second field rather than trusted:
**148 shared slugs, and the employer agrees on 148 of 148.** The five that
first looked like disagreements were one employer spelled two ways —
`H&M` folds to `h-m` here and `hamp-m` there, likewise `Q.T.S`, `G&G Group`
and `Lily's Cafe`.

*It is a floor, not a rate.* Both figures are what one request returned on
2026-09-07; neither board states a total, so neither 481 nor 566 is a claim
about everything either board holds.

TWO PLACES WHERE THE SHARED TEMPLATE DIVERGES, AND BOTH BITE

1. **`jobListExpires` is a countdown here and a date there.** It reads
   `15 ditë` — *fifteen days* — where ofertapune prints `21.09.2026`. A parser
   copied across would produce `None` on every row, or worse, parse the `15`.
   **The absolute deadline is in the `date=` attribute of `jobListTitle`**,
   as `2026-09-21 23:55:00`, and that is what this module reads.
2. **`ids=` is a position counter here and the advertisement's id there.**
   It runs `"5 0 100"`, `"6 0 101"` down the page. Reading it as an identifier
   would mint a ledger key that changes every time the page is reordered.
   **The listing carries no id at all**; `jobID="47268"` exists only on the
   advertisement page, so `list` keys on `<employer>/<slug>` and says so.

THE ONLY DATE IS AGAIN A DEADLINE

`Skadon 21/09/26 (15 ditë)` on the advertisement page, `date=` on the listing,
and no posting date anywhere on either. **`--since` is therefore not offered**:
a filter on a field the source does not carry returns everything in silence,
which reads exactly like a board on which nothing is old.

NO STRUCTURED DATA

`ld+json` and `JobPosting` are both absent from the homepage and from the
advertisement page. Every field is read from a class name, in Albanian.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-09-07

    /robots.txt        44 bytes — `Disallow: /cgi-bin/` and nothing else
    homepage           566 blocks, 516 distinct slugs, 391 employers
    fields             title 566/566 · employer 566/566 (in the URL)
                       expires 566/566 · city 566/566
    ld+json            0 · JobPosting 0

**`--strict` prints every block the parser could not read**, because a narrow
extractor does not return less, it returns false.
