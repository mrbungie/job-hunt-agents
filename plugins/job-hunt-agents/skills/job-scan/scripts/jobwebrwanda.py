"""JobWeb Rwanda (`jobwebrwanda.com`) — Rwanda's first adapter, and it has stopped.

  jobwebrwanda.py list [--since 2026-01-01] [--limit 20]
  jobwebrwanda.py list --fetch --limit 5      # 30 s PER advertisement
  jobwebrwanda.py ad --slug funding-and-reporting-officer-at-akagera-management-company

**558 advertisements, and nothing published since 2026-06-24** — two and a
half months at the time of writing, and zero dated on or after 1 August.

    558 advertisements   167 distinct dates   2019-05-08 → 2026-06-24
    busiest day            8, which is 1.4 %
    since 2026-06-01      66
    since 2026-08-01       0

*This is the most evenly spread board this repository has measured* — 1.4 % on
the busiest day, against 18.5 % for `jobartis` and 60.5 % for `ihararejobs`.
**A clean distribution and a dead board are not contradictory**: the site
published steadily for seven years and then stopped.

THE HOST ASKS FOR THIRTY SECONDS, AND IT GETS THEM

`robots.txt` is two lines: `User-agent: *` and **`Crawl-delay: 30`**. *That is
a directive, not a remark* — `ejob.az` taught this repository the same lesson
with a delay of 5.

**`list` costs one request. `--fetch` costs 30 s per advertisement**, so
reading the whole board would take four and a half hours. The flag says so
before it starts.

THE ROOT DEMANDS A LOGIN AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS DO NOT

    GET /                       302 → /login/?redirect_to=…/login/?redirect_to=…
    GET /sitemap.xml            200 → /sitemap_index.xml
    GET /job_listing-sitemap…   200
    GET /jobs/<slug>/           200, a complete JobPosting

**A redirect loop into a login page**, and the inventory behind it is public
anyway. *A reader that took the root as the board's answer would have filed
Rwanda as closed;* **the verdict is taken where the advertisements are, and
this module never requests `/`.**

*No account is created and none is needed. If the advertisements ever move
behind that login, this adapter stops and says so — it does not authenticate.*

THE SITEMAP'S DATE IS THE POSTING DATE HERE — CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED

`lastmod` equals `datePosted` on **3 of 3** sampled, including the most recent.
**So `--since` works on one request**, which is worth stating because the two
boards measured immediately before it could not:

    ihararejobs   the date MOVES when the page is read     our own crawl
    myjobsfiji    ONE value for 3 152 entries              a rebuild stamp
    jobwebrwanda  lastmod == datePosted, 3 of 3            the posting date

**A `lastmod` is worth nothing until it has been looked at, and there are at
least three ways for it to be worthless.**

NOTHING HERE IS LIKELY TO BE LIVE, AND THIS MODULE DOES NOT CLAIM A CENSUS

The most recent advertisement is dated 2026-06-24 and its own `validThrough`
is **2026-07-04** — already past. On the three sampled, `validThrough` falls
ten to eleven days after `datePosted`.

*If that interval holds, nothing on this board is live.* **It is an inference
from three, not a count**: liveness is per advertisement and costs one request
each at thirty seconds. `--live` exists, requires `--fetch`, and is honest
about what it just spent.

*Rwanda's country page recorded «201 offres vivantes» on 2026-09-04. This
module cannot reproduce that at a reasonable cost and does not contradict it —
it reports what the sitemap says and what three advertisements said.*

ONE SITEMAP BY NAME, NEVER A WILDCARD

`/job_listing-sitemap.xml`. **The index also offers `job_loc-`, `job_cat-` and
`job_type-`, which a `job_listing*` glob would sweep in** — they are
taxonomies, not advertisements, and this repository has paid for that mistake
before. The name is written out.

`/jobs/` itself appears among the entries and is not an advertisement: 559
`<loc>`, 558 advertisements.

Verified against the live site on 2026-09-08.
