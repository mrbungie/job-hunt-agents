"""Read Jamaica's Labour Market Information System — the whole board in one
request, and a search that cannot fail.

`lmis.gov.jm`, run by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. **No key, no
cookie, no browser** — the page renders client-side, and the endpoint it calls
answers a plain POST.

**The first public employment service in this series whose access is not
refused**, and the reason is worth stating precisely: its `robots.txt` is
**Drupal's shipped default**, 22 `Disallow` lines, all administrative —
`/node/add/`, `/user/`, `/search/`. **Nothing in it concerns the vacancies.**

**So the permission is accidental, and that does not make it less real.** The
symmetry with `empleate.gob.hn` is the point: there a file copied from Google's
documentation **forbids** the vacancies; here a file shipped with a CMS
**allows** them. **Neither operator wrote the rule that decides.** An
accidental permission is still a permission — and it is **not a welcome**. It
is an absence of objection, so this adapter fetches once, takes everything, and
does not come back.

  POST /api/job/listing   {"offset": 0, "limit": n}
      → 200 application/json, {"count": "16", "data": [...]}

**THE ENDPOINT ACCEPTS EVERY PARAMETER AND FILTERS ON NONE.** Measured
2026-09-03:

    {"job_title": "counsellor"}    → count 16, all 16 rows
    {"skills": "Communication"}    → count 16, all 16 rows
    {"job_title": "zzzznothing"}   → count 16, all 16 rows

`job_title` and `skills` are the site's **own** parameter names, read out of
`job-search.js`. They are accepted, echoed by nothing, and ignored. **A search
that cannot fail is not a search** — it is the `communalCodes` trap of
`job-room.md`, in its strongest form. So this file **offers no filter at all**
and narrows after the fetch, which costs nothing on a board of sixteen.

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT SIXTEEN ADS LET YOU SAY:

    ads                     16, and `count` agrees with the rows
    ads outside Jamaica      1 — a US Navy posting at Guantánamo, `CU`
    distinct employers       6
    expired but still listed 0 of 16
    location, skills filled  16 of 16
    `job_status`             "1" on 16 of 16 — constant, and a string
    `author`                 empty on 16 of 16

**`count` is a string, not a number** (`"16"`), and **`date` is relative
prose** — *"2 days 16 hours ago"* — not a date. `expiration_date` is ISO and is
the only date here that can be stored. **Zero expired of sixteen is measured
and is not a property**: sixteen is a small sample, and boards that serve
stale ads look identical until they do.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
