"""Fetch BTP job ads from emploi.batiactu.com — French construction.

**9 984 ads** of construction, public works and building engineering: the
largest French sector this plugin had no coverage for at all. Every ad carries
**coordinates**, which almost no board does — and a `streetAddress` that is the
employer's head office rather than the job's site. See `card`.

The `robots.txt` closes exactly one thing that matters, the search page
(`/offre-emploi-recherche.php*`), and leaves the browse paths open:

  /offre-emploi-BTP/localisation/<region>       21 regions
  /offre-emploi-BTP/metier/<metier>             24 trades
  …?page=<n>                                    20 ads a page

**The region is not a location.** A third of the "Île-de-France" page was
somewhere else entirely — the filter matches the *employer entity's name*, and
"Eurovia Délégation Île-de-France Normandie" posts jobs in the Manche. So the
region is a way to page through the board, never a way to know where the work
is. Filter on the postcode instead, which is on every ad: see `--departement`.

Usage:
  batiactu.py regions
  batiactu.py search --region ile-de-france --pages 5
  batiactu.py search --region ile-de-france --departement 75 --departement 92
  batiactu.py search --metier architecte

Output: one JSON object per line.
