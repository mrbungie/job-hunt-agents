"""May we offer to switch this board on? — the four states of a board in
someone's `config.yml`, and the only one that is an omission.

**Issue #80.** `cover-letter` handles a pasted URL from a board with *no*
adapter (file a `board-request`, silently). It says nothing about the more
useful case: **the adapter exists and works, and the board is simply not in the
user's config.** They go on pasting URLs one at a time from a board `job-scan`
could sweep for them every week.

**But three of the four states are deliberate, and re-offering them is
nagging.** `skills/job-scan/scripts/dormant.py` already draws the line this
depends on:

    absent from `boards:`          nobody ever decided — **this is the offer**
    enabled: true                  already swept; nothing to offer
    enabled: false, no dormancy    a HARD OFF. "never probed, never reported
                                   and never proposed" — dormant.py's words
    enabled: false + dormant_since a bet that could come good, and dormant.py
                                   owns its re-check date. Not this skill's
                                   business, and re-offering it every time a
                                   URL is pasted would nag the user out of
                                   trusting the offer at all

**A decline has somewhere to live already**: `enabled: false` with no
`dormant_since` is the hard off, and it silences this permanently. That is why
no `declined:` key is invented here — the vocabulary already has the word.

WHAT THE OFFER MUST SAY. Offering a board that will fail on its next run for a
missing setting is worse than silence, so this reports the adapter's **own**
declared requirements — the `| Key | Required |` table in
`shared/boards/<board>.md` — and says plainly when an adapter declares none
rather than implying it needs nothing. Measured 2026-09-02: **49 of 67
adapters carry that table**, and 10 mention credentials in an `~/.<board>.env`
file.

    board_offer.py check --board jobup
    board_offer.py check --board adzuna --config ~/Documents/job_applications/config.yml

One JSON object on stdout. `offer` is the answer; `reason` is why, in words
meant to be shown to nobody but the person reading this code.
