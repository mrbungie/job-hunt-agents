"""Does this ad require a driving licence or a vehicle — and did anybody ever
ask the candidate?

**Issue #91, and it is #82 on a different field.** `shared/scoring-rubric.md`
knows how to treat a stated must-have; **nothing collected this one.** The rule
existed, the value did not.

THE CASE, 2026-09-03. A Meanquest `Chef de projet IT` ad lists, at the same
height as everything else:

    **Permis de conduire obligatoire**

Not "an asset", not "a plus" — in a list where ITIL *is* explicitly only a
plus. Searched `candidate.md`, `repos.md` and five profile PDFs: **nothing**.
Not the licence, not the category, not a vehicle. The run wrote *"to verify
before drafting"* into the ledger, which was the right reaction and **turns a
stable fact into a question re-asked at every ad**.

TWO FIELDS, NEVER ONE. *Permis B* is the legal capacity to drive; *"véhicule
personnel indispensable"* is having a car. Ads ask for one, the other, or both,
and a single boolean loses the distinction that decides field roles.

**ABSENT FROM THE FILE IS NOT NO.** A false *"they don't have it"* costs an ad
wrongly dropped; a false *"they have it"* costs an interview. Both are real and
they land in different places — so while the field is unset this produces a
**question at the go/no-go gate and never an automatic discard.** Three states,
not two: held, declared not held, never asked.

WHY THE DETECTION IS THE HARD HALF, MEASURED ON 45 ADS AND ONE WORKSPACE:

- **`permis` alone is worthless.** Of 13 `permis <word>` matches in one
  workspace: **7 driving licence, 5 work permit** — the #82 object, an entirely
  different field — **and 1 the ordinary French past participle** (*"seule la
  recherche a permis de conclure"*). Six of thirteen are not this.
- **`permis` is also a prefix of `permission`.** A stem match hits *"gestion
  des permissions"* in a backend ad about file sharing.
- **`permis B` is the Swiss residence permit**, not driving category B, and on
  a Swiss board that is the commoner reading by far. So a bare category letter
  is **never** read as a licence here: it raises a question instead.
- **Bare `vehicle` is a false friend in this repository's own vocabulary.**
  *"The employment vehicle"* — B2B versus local employment — appears in **5 of
  45 ad files and 0 of them is a car.**

**So the matcher is an allow-list of phrases, never a stem**, for the same
reason `vieclam24h.py` emits an allow-list: the narrow version fails visibly
and the broad version fails silently.

AND RUN IT ON THE AD, NOT ON THE FILE. All five `vehicle` false positives were
in the plugin's own analysis prose, not in the employer's words. A corpus that
mixes the ad with what we wrote about it cannot validate a detector.
