"""Which board cards name a host that no longer answers for itself.

**A board that has been bought reaches us as a redirect long before it reaches
us as a rename.** Nobody sends an announcement; the infrastructure moves at
once. Four cases turned up in four hours on 2026-09-03, all by the same
mechanism — since #99 a verdict names the host that **answered** rather than
the string that was asked for, so a cross-host redirect stopped being
swallowed:

    my.indeed.com          → secure.indeed.com
    jobs.recruitee.com     → careers.tellent.com      Recruitee is Tellent
    talent-soft.com        → www.cegid.com            Talentsoft is Cegid
    digitalrecruiters.com  → www.cegid.com            the same, twice

**None of them was known here.** And `talentsoft` is the one that bites:
`www.cegid.com` answers 268 KB of HTML, so its `robots.txt` comes back
`unreadable` — **and an `unreadable` reads as a server accident, not as an
acquisition.**

The consequence goes past the name: **a card describing the access policy of
`talent-soft.com` describes a host that no longer serves anything.** The rules
that apply are the receiving platform's, and nobody has read them.

**AND WHAT DRIFTED IS `/robots.txt`, NOT THE HOST.** This tool reads one path,
so a `MOVED` line says *that host's rules file now lives elsewhere* and
**nothing about any other path on it**. Measured while updating the cards:
`entreprise.francetravail.fr/robots.txt` lands on `pro.francetravail.fr`, and
the OAuth endpoint the adapter actually calls **answers under the old name
without redirecting**. The operator is moving its portal and has left the
partner API where it was. **Generalising from one path to a host is the same
step as generalising from one ad to a board**, and it was taken here before it
was caught.

**AND A REDIRECT CAN BE INTERMITTENT, SO READ THE TWO OUTCOMES DIFFERENTLY.**
`my.indeed.com` sent this repository to `secure.indeed.com` in the afternoon
and answered under its own name an hour later. **One observation of drift is a
finding; one observation of no drift is not a clearance** — which is this
repository's rule on independent measurements, turned on the tool that applies
it.

THIS IS A MAINTENANCE DIAGNOSTIC, NOT A RUNTIME CHECK. Four cases in four
hours does not mean four a day; it means **an unexamined backlog empties fast
the first time.** Run it when cards are reviewed.

**AND IT READS A DECLARED FIELD, NEVER PROSE.** `bin/adapter-age.sh` carries
the reason: it once took any date it could find in a file and reported a board
1 384 days stale because the file quoted a date it had measured. *A script that
reads "any date" has no field, it has a heuristic.* The same trap caught the
first draft of this one — extracting hosts from module constants pulled `jobs`
out of a regex literal, a host that is not a host. So:

    <!-- hosts: www.example.com, api.example.com -->

near the top of a board card, beside `<!-- verified: -->`. **A card without one
is reported UNDECLARED — not skipped, and not guessed at.** The absence of a
declaration is not a clean bill; it is the backlog, made visible.

    **So this report used to consult the guard about a host nobody fetches.**
    Its green said *the declared host has not moved*, which was true and was
    not the question. Six cards were in that position. #173, #175.

    Literal forms only: a template like `{tenant}.recruitee.com` names no host
