"""Does every adapter enumerate the fields it emits?

**Issue #75. Name what you emit, not what you drop.** A deny-list is a bet that
the problem was enumerated correctly; an allow-list is a bet that the *need*
was. The two failure modes are not symmetric:

- an allow-list that is too narrow produces **a missing field** — visible,
  reported, fixed in one line;
- a deny-list that is too narrow produces **a leak** — invisible, persistent,
  and found by somebody else.

The same asymmetry as `_robots.py` passing on an unreadable file and as #67
putting the caveat in the field name: **when two errors are possible, prefer
the one that announces itself.**

The case that produced the rule: `vieclam24h`'s ad record carries 110 fields,
including a named recruiter's phone, email and address **and the board's own
account manager**. Dropping `employer_info` by name — the obvious fix — would
have left four of the five contact fields behind.

WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT. It resolves each `json.dumps(...)` that
reaches stdout back to the expression that built it, following one local
assignment and one function call, and asks whether the result is a **dict
written out key by key**. It reports three verdicts:

    enumerated   every emit site resolves to a dict with named keys
    allow-list   the same, and the keys come from a named tuple (KEEP)
    unresolved   this tool could not follow it — **read it yourself**

**`unresolved` is not `leaking`.** It means the analysis stopped, and saying
otherwise would be the plausible-false-number this repository keeps catching:
a first version of this file called 80 sites suspicious, of which nearly all
were `c = card(...)` one line above.
