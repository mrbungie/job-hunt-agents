"""Read jobs.ge — Georgia's independent generalist, and the whole board is one
request.

**No key, no cookie, no browser, and no pagination.** The home page carries
**every live vacancy**: 308 distinct ad ids on 2026-09-03, on both language
versions, with no `page` parameter anywhere on it. A complete sweep costs one
fetch.

`robots.txt` is **54 bytes**: one `Disallow: /data/clients/`, no sitemap, no AI
agent named — and **`Crawl-delay: 5`**, which is a published rate limit and the
default here. It is the first explicit crawl delay in this repository's
adapters, and it is honoured rather than noted.

  GET /ge/                      → every live ad, as `?view=jobs&id=<n>` links
  GET /ge/?view=jobs&id=<n>     → one ad, server-rendered, no structured data
  GET /en/?view=jobs&id=<n>     → the same ad, and usually **a stub**

**THE ENGLISH PAGE IS A STUB, AND IT ANSWERS 200.** On the same advertisement:

    /en/   614 visible characters   "See full text of this announcement in Georgian"
    /ge/  3 943 visible characters   the whole posting

**An adapter reading `/en/` scores the ad on one sentence** — a well-formed
page, a correct status, and the wrong question answered. So this file reads
`/ge/` by default and **refuses to hand back an English body silently**: the
card carries `is_stub`, and `--lang en` says what it costs.

**The ratio is not the test — the sentence is.** One sampled ad ran 623
characters in English against 767 in Georgian, a factor of 1.2, and was a stub
all the same. A threshold on length would have passed it.

A FALSE POSITIVE WORTH KNOWING: the ad page contains the words **"All Job Ads
on a Single Page"**, which reads exactly like a full-board view. **It is the
caption of a banner advertisement for one employer.** A string that describes a
feature and is a advert.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
