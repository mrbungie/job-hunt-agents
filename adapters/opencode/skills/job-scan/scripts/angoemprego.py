"""Ango Emprego (`angoemprego.com`) — Angola's second adapter.

  angoemprego.py list [--since 2026-08-01] [--limit 20] [--fetch] [--live]
  angoemprego.py ad --slug gerente-de-balcao

**The smallest archive of the three Angolan boards and the largest flow.**
`jobartis.com` holds 40 882 advertisements and published 216 since 1 August;
this one holds 1 434 and published 924. *That inversion is the whole reason
this board was built second.*

**Corrected 2026-09-08: 38 547 -> 40 882, and 202 -> 216.** *The old figure
counted the `/emprego-<slug>` form alone and missed 2 294 advertisements under
a bare `/<slug>`; the correction was made on 2026-09-07 in `jobartis.md`,
`angoemprego.md`, `angolaemprego.md` and the README — and **this docstring was
the one place it did not reach**, because a docstring is not a card and nothing
greps it.* **The clause «&nbsp;and the largest was not built at all&nbsp;» is
also removed: `jobartis.py` shipped on 2026-09-07**, so the sentence explaining
why this adapter exists had begun explaining a state of the repository that no
longer held.

WORDPRESS JOB MANAGER: THE ADVERTISEMENTS ARE IN THEIR OWN FILES

The index declares fifteen children. **Two carry advertisements and eight
carry blog posts**, and they are named rather than globbed:

    job_listing-sitemap.xml    1 000 <loc>
    job_listing-sitemap2.xml     434 <loc>
                               -----
                               1 434, all distinct, all under /vagas/
    post-sitemap1..8.xml       NOT read — blog posts
    job_listing_region · job_listing_tag · category · misc   NOT read

*Aggregating `job_listing*` with a wildcard would be one keystroke and would
also sweep `job_listing_region` and `job_listing_tag`, which are taxonomies.*
**A sibling file is not the same kind of thing as its neighbour**, and this
repository has swept 15 940 tenders into a job count that way once.

TWO BLOCKS, AND SIX YEARS OF NOTHING BETWEEN THEM

    2020   349 advertisements ·  9 dates · 2020-10-15 … 2020-11-23
                                          226 on one day — 65 % of the block
           ——— nothing at all between 2020-11-23 and 2026-07-29 ———
    2026 1 085 advertisements · 35 dates · 2026-07-29 … 2026-09-07
                                          busiest 96 — 8.8 % of the block
                                          median 30 a day

**The busiest-day check fired first at 15.8 % of the whole file, and reading
the distribution said what it was**: a launch block of 2020, not a defect in
the current flow. *The check flags; it does not conclude.* See
`shared/plausible-and-false.md`.

**So `--since` is what makes this board usable**, and the default listing
carries both blocks with their dates so the gap stays visible.

THE DATES ARE PUBLICATION DATES, AND THAT WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED

    lastmod 2026-08-18 · datePosted 2026-08-18     4 of 4 sampled
    lastmod 2026-08-26 · datePosted 2026-08-26
    lastmod 2026-08-20 · datePosted 2026-08-20
    lastmod 2026-08-18 · datePosted 2026-08-18

*The file has 44 distinct dates for 1 434 advertisements and **not one day
carrying a single advertisement**, which is what a regeneration stamp looks
like.* **It is not one**: the sitemap's date is the advertisement's own, on
four of four. **A suspicion checked and refuted is worth as much as one
confirmed**, and `myjobsfiji.com` — its whole sitemap under one
`lastmod` — is why it gets checked at all.

`baseSalary` IS present and is NOT emitted: it reads `currency: USD` with an
empty `value` on an Angolan board, where the currency is the kwanza. *The same
shape as `négociable XPF` on `burundijobs`* — **a field present and wrong is
worse than one absent**, and what a field is worth is a property of the board.

`strict=False` is applied from the first line here: its Angolan neighbour's
`JobPosting` block carries a raw control character, and the zero a
single-attempt parser returns looks exactly like a site with no structured
data.
