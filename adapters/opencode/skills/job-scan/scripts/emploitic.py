"""Fetch Algerian ads from Emploitic — by the sitemap the operator declares.

Algeria's largest private job board. **No key, no cookie, no browser**: every
advertisement carries a `JobPosting` and a `__NEXT_DATA__`, and the route is
the one `robots.txt` names itself.

  GET /robots.txt          → `Sitemap: https://emploitic.com/sitemap.xml`
  GET /sitemap.xml         → three families; `sitemap-jobs.xml` is the ads
  GET /sitemap-jobs.xml    → 4 237 <loc>, every one an advertisement
                             (2026-09-08; 4 506 on 2026-09-03 — the board
                             lost 269 in five days, measured the same way)
  GET <ad url>             → one `JobPosting`, plus `__NEXT_DATA__`

**THE SITEMAP IS THE ROUTE HERE, AND THE NEIGHBOURING BOARD'S IS A TRAP.**
`jobivoire.ci` publishes a sitemap too and it is five weeks stale; this one is
current to the minute — newest `lastmod` **2026-09-03T20:37**, measured while
this file was written. **The two boards are read in opposite ways for reasons
measured on each**, and `jobivoire.py` carries the other half of that warning.
Do not carry the habit of one across to the other.

**BOTH URL SHAPES ARE ADVERTISEMENTS, AND THAT WAS CHECKED.** The file mixes

    /offres-d-emploi/<sector>/<slug>                          977
    /entreprises/<company>/offres-d-emploi/<sector>/<slug>   3 530

and the second shape reads like an employer landing page. **It is not**: three
sampled across the range each carry exactly one `JobPosting`. Counting only
the first shape would have reported a board a fifth of its size — the mistake
`hr.ge` records in the other direction, where 39 247 `<loc>` held 1 062 ads.

**TITLES ARE NOT ALWAYS PLAIN TEXT.** One employer publishes
`𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹` in mathematical-bold Unicode. The card carries the
title as published and flags it, because a keyword match against `Technico`
fails on characters that look identical to a reader.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
