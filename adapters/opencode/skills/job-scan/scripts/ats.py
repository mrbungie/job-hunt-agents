"""Read one employer's job board directly from its ATS.

Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby and SmartRecruiters each publish the postings of a
given employer as public JSON — the same feed that powers that employer's
careers page. No key, no cookie, no browser. What they do NOT offer is a search
across employers: you ask for one tenant at a time, which is why this is the
adapter family for "I want to work at X", not for discovery.

SmartRecruiters is the odd one of the four: it paginates (100 per page, silently
clamped), it needs a second request per ad for the description, and it is the
only one with server-side filters — see --country.

**join.com is the odd one of the seven.** It publishes no JSON feed at all — it
is a Next.js app, and the whole payload rides in the page's own `__NEXT_DATA__`,
which is a complete state object rather than markup to scrape. It is also the
only provider here that hands the description over **already cut into `intro`,
`tasks`, `requirements`, `benefits` and `outro`** — `requirements` on its own is
what the scoring rubric actually reads. And it is the only one whose money is
stored in **minor units**: `2035` means `20.35`. See `join_money`.

Usage:
  ats.py list --provider greenhouse --tenant elastic [--location Switzerland]
              [--keywords kubernetes] [--posted-within-days 30] [--remote]
  ats.py list --provider smartrecruiters --tenant nexthink --country ch
  ats.py list --provider join --tenant simplee-energy --with-description
  ats.py ad   --provider greenhouse --tenant elastic --id 8148720
  ats.py resolve "Nexthink"        # employer name -> provider + tenant

`resolve` asks HiringCafe, which records the ATS and tenant of every ad it
indexes. It is a lookup aid for setup, not a sweep.

    as a refusal on 2026-09-07, and as an absence of rules since #201

    rule) — and `ats.py --provider ashby` read it anyway, on every run, since

    explicitly closed **and** a keyed API; this endpoint asks for no key.

    **What let it hide is an enumeration that was true and incomplete.**
    `smartrecruiters_gate`'s docstring lists four verified hosts and every word

    mention, and it is the one that refuses. *Nothing distinguishes a true
    partial list from an exhaustive one* — which the same docstring says four
