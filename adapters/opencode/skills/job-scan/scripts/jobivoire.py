"""Fetch Ivorian ads from JobIvoire — by pagination, because its sitemap lies.

Côte d'Ivoire's job board. `robots.txt` is two lines and closes nothing:
`User-agent: *` and a bare `Disallow:`. **It declares no sitemap**, and the one
that exists should not be used.

  GET /job?page=<n>          → 12 advertisement links; 324 pages
  GET /job/<slug>            → one advertisement, with a clean `JobPosting`
  (it was /job/details/<slug> until 2026-09-08; both forms are read, one is built)

**THE SITEMAP IS A TRAP, AND THAT IS WHY THIS PAGINATES.** Measured
2026-09-03:

    /sitemap.xml     311 <loc>, of which 227 under /job/details/
                     newest lastmod  2026-07-28
    /job?page=N      324 pages: 323 x 12 + 8 = 3 884 advertisements

**The sitemap holds 227 of 3 884 — six per cent — and its freshest entry is
five weeks old**, while the listing publishes twelve advertisements dated
today. An adapter written on it would miss **94% of the board and never meet
an error**: 200s all the way, a plausible count, nothing to catch.

**Emploitic, next door in Algeria, is the opposite case** — its sitemap is
declared in `robots.txt` and current to the minute, and `emploitic.py` uses it.
**Two neighbouring boards, two opposite routes, each measured.** Carrying the
habit of one to the other is the only real risk in this pair.

PAGINATION, CHECKED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Pages 1, 2, 200 and 324 were read and
compared: 12, 12, 12 and 8 links, **zero overlap between any pair**, and page
325 returns none. `323 x 12 + 8 = 3 884` exactly.

**THE LISTING'S OWN `ld+json` DOES NOT PARSE, AND THE ADVERTISEMENT'S DOES.**
The listing carries one block naming twelve `JobPosting`s, and it is invalid
JSON: a title reads `d\\&#039;Atelier` — a backslash before an HTML entity,
which is not an escape. `json.loads` refuses it with or without `strict=False`.

**So this reads the advertisement links out of the markup and the fields off
each advertisement page**, where the block is well formed. `_ldjson`'s
`absent_reason()` reports the listing block as `unparseable` with
`our_fault=True`, which is correct and is why nothing here silently returns
zero: **a page that says `JobPosting` and yields none has been misread.**

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
