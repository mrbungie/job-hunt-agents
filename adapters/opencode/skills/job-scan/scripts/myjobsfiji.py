**190 advertisements inside a sitemap of 3 152 URLs.** The other 2 962 are
company pages, blog posts, categories, cities, states and countries.

    /company/…   2 790      /categories/…   37      /countries/…   11
    /job/…         190      /jobs/…         34      /cities/…      23
    /blog/…         45      /states/…       14      other            8

**Counting the file would report this board 3 152 against 190 — 16.6 times
larger** — the widest such gap this repository has measured. *`jobsbotswana` was
368-against-367 and `ihararejobs` 6 503-against-6 295; here it is
3 152-against-190, and the excess is not noise, it is a directory of
employers.*

THE SITEMAP'S `lastmod` IS A SINGLE VALUE, AND IT IS TODAY

**All 3 152 entries carry `2026-09-07`.** One distinct value across the whole
file: it is the timestamp of the file's regeneration, not of anything's
publication. *Fiji's country page recorded this on 2026-09-04 and it is
unchanged.*

**So `--since` is refused on the sitemap** and offered only with `--fetch`,
where it filters `datePosted` from the advertisement's own schema. Those dates
are real and spread — eight distinct days across ten sampled, 2026-08-16 to
2026-09-05.

*This is the second board measured on 2026-09-07 whose sitemap date says
nothing, and the two say nothing for different reasons: `ihararejobs` moves
its dates when a page is read, this one stamps every row with one rebuild.*
**A `lastmod` is not evidence of anything until it has been looked at.**

THE SCHEMA IS COMPLETE AND ONE OF ITS FIELDS IS NOT

Each advertisement carries a full `JobPosting`, and `strict` JSON parsed all
ten sampled — no lax pass needed here, unlike `ihararejobs` at six of eight.

    datePosted      10/10      validThrough   10/10
    employmentType  10/10      hiringOrganization.name  10/10
    baseSalary.value.minValue   1/10

**`baseSalary` is present on every advertisement and empty on nine of ten**:
`{"currency": "FJD", "value": {"minValue": "", "maxValue": "", "unitText":
"YEAR"}}`. *A reader that emitted the object would hand a consumer a salary
structure with nothing in it.*

**The empty ones carry `unitText: "YEAR"` — a default, sitting beside no
value at all.** *A reader that emitted the object would hand a consumer a
yearly salary structure containing nothing, which is worse than absence
because it looks like a schema that was filled in.*

**The one filled example is correct**: `minValue: "6.10"` with
`unitText: "HOUR"`, a Fijian hourly wage. So this module emits
`salary_fjd_min` and `salary_fjd_max` **only when non-empty**, and carries
`salary_unit_text` beside them so the reader never has to assume the period.

*An earlier draft of this docstring said the filled row read `6.10` against
`YEAR` and called it an hourly rate under a yearly label. That was wrong: the
`YEAR` came from an empty record and the `6.10` from a different
advertisement.* **Two records, one conclusion, and it took exercising the
branch rather than re-reading it to see.**

THE BOARD IS FIJIAN AND SOME ADVERTISEMENTS ARE NOT

One of ten sampled is a UNICEF post in **Honiara, `addressCountry: "Solomon
Islands"`**. *A country taken from the board rather than from the
advertisement would file it under Fiji.*

So `countries` is read from the advertisement when `--fetch` supplies it, and
`country_name` travels verbatim beside it. **A country name this module has no
code for yields an empty `countries` and says so** — an empty list is honest,
a wrong ISO code is not.

*Without `--fetch` there is no country in hand at all, and the rows carry the
board's own jurisdiction with `country_basis` saying exactly that.*
