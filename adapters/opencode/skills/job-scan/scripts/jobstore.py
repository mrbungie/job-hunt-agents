"""Discover Jobstore ads over plain HTTP — the half that does not need a
browser.

Jobstore runs 26 country sites off one host, `www.jobstore.com/<cc>/`, and
this adapter is **hybrid by necessity**: discovery is plain HTTP, **reading an
ad needs the user's Chrome**, because the ad page answers a plain client with
**HTTP 403 and a 5 832-byte "Just a moment…" interstitial** while the search
page and the sitemaps answer 200.

  GET /<cc>/sitemap/sitemap_index.xml        → 200 application/xml
  GET /<cc>/sitemap/job-<n>.xml              → 200, ONE AD PER <loc>
  GET /<cc>/jobs/search?q=&l=&page=          → 200, an ItemList of ad URLs
  GET /<cc>/job/l<id>/<slug>-job             → **403 to a plain client**

COUNT `job-*.xml` AND NOTHING ELSE. The Swiss index declares twelve
sub-sitemaps and only six of them are ads:

    job-1..6.xml            52 128 <loc>   ← the ads
    jobs-search-1..4.xml   ~200 000 <loc>  ← query landing pages
    employer-1.xml           3 876
    salary-1.xml             1 984

Summing every `<loc>` reports **more than 250 000 Swiss ads where there are
52 128**. Nothing errors, nothing warns, and the number is five times too
large — the one mistake here that produces a confident wrong figure. This
script reads `job-*.xml` only and says so.

WHAT THE HTTP HALF CAN AND CANNOT SEE. The search page's `ld+json` is an
`ItemList` of **URLs only** — no title, no employer, no location, no salary.
The ad id and a slug are all that plain HTTP yields, so the card here carries
`id`, `url` and a `title_from_slug` **named for what it is**: a guess derived
from a URL, not the board's own title.

APPLYING IS NOT WHAT THE BUTTON SAYS. The ad page shows **"Apply on company
site"**, twice. Its `href` is
`https://www.jobstore.com/jobseeker/apply/l<id>` — **a Jobstore path**, and
`robots.txt` disallows `/*/jobseeker/apply/`. Applying needs a Jobstore
account. Read from the DOM, not by clicking. **The plugin says so plainly
rather than repeating the label.**

Verified against the Swiss site on **2026-09-02**.
