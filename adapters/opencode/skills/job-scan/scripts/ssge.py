"""Enumerate ss.ge's job board — **and refuse to read it, on purpose.**

Georgia's largest classifieds site. Its jobs section is **1 705 live
advertisements**, and this adapter finds every one of them without fetching a
single advertisement page. That is not a limitation to be worked around; it is
the shape of the site, and the reason is written below.

THREE HOSTS AND THREE DIFFERENT `robots.txt` FILES, measured 2026-09-03:

    ss.ge          478 bytes   BOM, a malformed first line, and it
                               **disallows `/en/jobs` and `/ru/jobs`**
    home.ss.ge     105 bytes   a different file — **the job refusals are not
                               in it** — declaring `ss.ge/sitemap.xml`
    jobs.ss.ge      62 bytes   `Allow: /`, declaring `ss.ge/sitemap-jobs.xml`

**The host every request is redirected to has the more permissive file.**
`shared/robots-policy.md`'s *test the apex and the `www` separately* has never
bitten this hard: these are not two files differing by a `Sitemap:` line, they
are **three files with different refusals**, and which one governs depends on
which host you end up on.

**The jobs board is a subdomain, not a prefix and not a parameter.**
`ss.ge/jobs` → `ss.ge/ka/jobs` → `jobs.ss.ge/ka/`. So `ss.ge`'s refusal of
`/en/jobs` is a refusal of a **redirect stub**, and the file that governs the
board itself says `Allow: /`.

**AND THE BOARD IS BEHIND A CLOUDFLARE CHALLENGE.** `jobs.ss.ge/ka/` answers
**403 with "Just a moment…"**, as does `home.ss.ge`. Permission is open and
the door is shut — *a `robots.txt` verdict is not an access verdict*, in the
direction that costs.

**A challenge that asks for a click is a stop.** `shared/robots-policy.md` says
so, and this file obeys it: `ad` **does not fetch**. It hands the URL to the
person, who has a browser and a click.

WHAT IS READABLE, AND IT IS MOST OF WHAT MATTERS. `jobs.ss.ge`'s `robots.txt`
declares **`https://ss.ge/sitemap-jobs.xml`** — on the apex, which is *not*
challenged, and **absent from the apex's own sitemap index**, whose 21 files
are all real estate. Reading the file for discovery found what the index
omitted (#74). It holds 56 sub-sitemaps:

    20 × /ka/ads/<n>     the advertisements — **1 705 distinct**
    20 × /en/ads/<n>     the same ads in English
    16 × sitemap-listing-<n>.xml   search-filter URLs, **not advertisements**

TWO THINGS THIS FILE WILL NOT DO:

- **It never fetches `ss.ge/en/jobs/…` or `ss.ge/ru/jobs/…`.** The apex refuses
  them by name. That the jobs sitemap advertises English files under that very
  prefix is a **conflict between two of the operator's own files**, and a
  `Sitemap:` line is not a permission: the refusal governs.
- **It never fetches `jobs.ss.ge`.** See the challenge, above.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
