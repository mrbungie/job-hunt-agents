"""Sweep jobup.ch and jobs.ch over plain HTTP — no browser, no cookie, no login.

**The adapter files made the Chrome extension a prerequisite**, so a user
without it had no Swiss sweep at all, on the two largest boards in this
repository. Measured 2026-09-02: twelve ads and three listing pages answer
`200` to a plain request, and **the structured data is in the HTML that
arrives**. Issue #68.

WHERE THE DATA IS, WHICH IS NOT WHERE THE ISSUE EXPECTED IT. The listing page
carries **one `JobPosting` per card**, wrapped in an `ItemList`:

    {"@type": "ItemList", "itemListElement":
       [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1,
         "item": {"@type": "JobPosting", …}}, …]}

and those carry **title, employer, date, employment type, url, identifier and
the location** — `addressLocality` filled on 13 of 20. **The ad page's own
`jobLocation` is empty on 12 of 12**, so the geography lives on the listing and
only there. A sweep that reads ad pages for location loses it.

*(`_ldjson.py` unwraps `ItemList` because of this: it previously saw zero
postings on a page holding twenty.)*

TWO THINGS THE LISTING DOES NOT CARRY: the full description and any salary.
The description is on the ad page, in its own `JobPosting`, 1 443 to 6 247
characters. `--with-description` fetches it, one request per ad.

A PROMOTED CARD IS REPEATED ACROSS PAGES. Measured: one ad sat at position 13
of page 1 **and position 1 of page 2**. So ids are deduplicated and the repeats
are counted out loud — **but a repeat is not a pagination failure**, and the
two are told apart: a page whose ids are *entirely* contained in what came
before has not advanced (exit 6), while a handful of repeats is paid placement.

AND AN AD URL ANSWERS IN FOUR WAYS, WHICH `ad` READS BEFORE ITS BODY.
`shared/boards/jobup.md` has the table: `410` is gone and still serves the ad's
own block, an expired ad **redirects to its trade's category page** carrying
twenty valid postings and no mention of the job, `404` never existed, and only
a plain `200` is the advert. **The block count decides none of it** (#88).
