WHY THIS EXISTS

`Crawl-delay` was dropped by the rules parser until 2026-09-05, so **no adapter
in this repository had ever applied one**. Measured that day:

    76 adapters touch the network
    65 of 71 whose fetch wrapper could be identified make several requests
       to the same host — 92 %, not the exception
    33 have no spacing of any kind
     0 read the host's delay

And the concrete case is a host on our own cards:

    careers.icims.com/robots.txt   84 bytes, md5 2a0e78d4b005, 12:14:48Z
        User-agent: *
        Allow: /
        crawl-delay: 5

    icims.py   3 requests per run, no spacing at all

**The host asks for five seconds and we give none.**

THE DELAY COMES FROM THE HOST, NEVER FROM A NUMBER WE PICKED

`Pace(host)` reads `_robots.verdict(host)["crawl_delay"]`. **When the host sets
none, this waits `own` — the adapter's own existing spacing — and nothing
else.** It does not invent a second, or a half: *a default of one second is a
choice, not a measurement*, and dressing a choice as a host's request is the
species this repository keeps catching.

Where both exist, the **longer** wins. An adapter that already sleeps 2s on a
host asking 5s waits 5; one that sleeps 2s on a host asking nothing keeps its 2.
Neither is weakened by the other.

PACING AND BACK-OFF STAY TWO THINGS

They had to be separated even to count — 47 adapters carrying `time.sleep`
turned out to be 43 spacing plus 4 backing off from 429/503. **This module does
pacing only.** A retry after a refusal answers a different question, is driven
by the response rather than the rules, and belongs where it already is.
