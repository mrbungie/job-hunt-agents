"""Fetch Saudi ads from Mihnati — **17 from the home page, and that is not the
board.**

Mihnati is a Saudi job board running on Rozee's platform, and the platform
shows through in ways that matter. `robots.txt` closes 17 path families and
leaves the English site open; **the Arabic one is refused** — `Disallow: /ar/`
and `/EN/ar/` — along with `/hiring/`, `/people/`, `/UR/` and `/ZH/`.

  GET /EN/                          → 17 advertisements, server-rendered
  GET /EN/<slug>-jobs-<id>          → one advertisement, with `JobPosting`

**THE LISTING IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS SERVER-RENDERED, AND IT IS A STRIP.**
`/EN/category/<x>`, `/EN/channel/<x>`, `/EN/search/<x>` and `/EN/job/jsearch/`
all answer 200 with 200-460 kB and **zero advertisement links**: the results
are drawn by script. So `latest` returns the seventeen the home page carries
and **says they are seventeen**, not a total. Reading the rest needs a browser,
and this adapter does not pretend otherwise.

THREE THINGS THE `JobPosting` GETS WRONG, ALL MEASURED ON TEN OF TEN ADS,
2026-09-03:

**1. The currency is `PKR` on Saudi jobs.** Ten of ten — Jeddah, Riyadh,
Dammam, `addressCountry: SA` — carry `baseSalary.currency: "PKR"`. Pakistani
rupees, from the Pakistani platform underneath (the same one named in this
host's own `robots.txt`: `/rozee-a/`, `/rozee-b/`). **A row that copied that
field would price a Saudi salary in the wrong currency by a factor of about
seventy.** So `salary_currency_disagrees_with_country` travels beside it, and
the figure is never converted — **guessing the intended currency would be a
second invention on top of the first.**

**2. `identifier` is the employer's name, not an identifier.** Ten of ten:

    "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Ansaaj"}

The schema.org field for the posting's id holds the company. **An adapter
reading it as an id would key every advertisement by its employer**, and two
jobs at one company would collide in a ledger. The id here is the number at
the end of the URL, and nothing else is used.

**3. Every page carries the `JobPosting` twice.** Ten of ten, byte-identical.
`_ldjson.postings()` returns both, correctly — it is reporting what is there —
so this script takes the first and **counts the duplication rather than
letting it double a total**.

THE 404 ANNOUNCES ITSELF IN THE QUERY STRING. `/jobs` and `/sitemap.xml`
answer **200** after redirecting to `/site/error?e=cnf_jobs` and
`?e=cnf_sitemap.xml`. Another *200 with the wrong body* — but this one is
checkable without guessing, because the final URL names the missing
controller.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
