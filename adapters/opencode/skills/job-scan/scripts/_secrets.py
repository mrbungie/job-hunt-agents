"""Credentials: the environment first, then a file in the user's workspace.

**"From the environment, and from nowhere else" is unworkable outside a
terminal.** In CoWork the shell is reset between calls, so an exported variable
does not survive from one to the next — `set -a; . ~/.adzuna.env; set +a` is
not merely tedious there, it **cannot work**. Issue #110.

**So a second place, and never a replacement.** The environment still wins; the
file is what a person can create once and keep.

    <workspace>/credentials.env          # or ~/.<name>.env, still read

**The security rule does not move**, and it is the reason this is a file and
not a config key:

- **Never in `config.yml`** — that file is read aloud, pasted into issues and
  backed up.
- **Never in git** — the workspace is the user's data directory, not a
  repository.
- **Never pasted into the conversation.** The plugin does not type secrets.

**And the message when a key is missing must say what to do where it is being
read.** Prescribing `export` and `chmod 600` to somebody who has no shell is
not help; neither is prescribing a file to somebody who is holding a terminal.
`missing_note()` gives both, and says which is which.

    from _secrets import get
    app_id = get("ADZUNA_APP_ID")

Format: `KEY=value` a line, `#` comments, optional `export ` prefix, quotes
stripped. **It is not a shell**: nothing is evaluated, nothing is expanded.
