"""GLMIS — Ghana Labour Market Information System (`www.glmis.gov.gh`).

  glmis.py list [--job-type 1] [--region 3] [--subsector 8] [--workplace 2]
  glmis.py sweep --dimension job-type        # every declared value, deduplicated
  glmis.py ad --id 5424

**Ghana's first adapter.** Its only other card, `melr-gh.md`, is the ministry
site and is not a board: its single employment route answers 404. *It names
GLMIS in prose and gives no address; `glmis.md` records how the hostname was
obtained — read, not composed.*

THERE IS NO PAGINATION, AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE ANY COUNT

```
markup searched for   pagination · pager · page-link · PageNumber
                      pageIndex · LoadMore · data-page · next
found                 none, on any of them
the listing is        <form method="get" id="jobFilterForm"
                            action="/Jobs/Joblistings">
```

**So there is no page 2 to ask for.** Reach comes from the form's own filters,
and **the module never composes a page number or an advertisement id** — the
ids run 2312…5424 and enumerating them would be composition of exactly the
kind that naming a host from an acronym would be.

TEN PER QUERY, AND TEN MAY BE A CAP

Measured 2026-09-07, six requests:

```
no filter        10 ids
jobTypeId=1      10 ids   1 new
jobTypeId=2       0 ids           <- a real empty facet
jobTypeId=3       1 id
jobTypeId=4       1 id    1 new
jobTypeId=5       0 ids
                 --------
union            12 distinct advertisements, ids 2312 … 5424
```

**Two of the six returned exactly ten — the same number the unfiltered view
returns — so a cap of ten per query cannot be ruled out**, and more may sit
behind those two. *No total is stated by this module, and `content:` on the
card states none either.*

**The id range is evidence that more exist than are listed**, not a count of
them: a filtered query surfaced id 2312 that the unfiltered listing does not
show.

THE FILTER VALUES ARE DECLARED, NOT GUESSED

Every value below was read from the form's own `<select>` options on
2026-09-07. **A value this module does not know is refused rather than sent**
— submitting an unknown id would be composing a facet.

NO STRUCTURED DATA, SO HTML — AND THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS PRINTED

`ld+json` is absent from the root, the listing and the advertisement.
**`JobPosting` appears nine times on the homepage and every one is a path
segment** — `/JobPostings/JobDetails/…` — not a schema type. *A counter that
matched the word would have reported nine structured advertisements on a site
with none.*

**`--strict` prints every card the parser could not read**, one per line.
*A narrow extractor does not return less, it returns false, and its silence
has the shape of an absence* — the defect this repository reproduced twice on
2026-09-07, once on the very card that documented it.

Verified against the live site on 2026-09-07.
