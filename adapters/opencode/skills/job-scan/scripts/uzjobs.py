"""UzJobs (`uzjobs.uz`) — Uzbekistan's first adapter, and the country page said
it was unreadable.

  uzjobs.py list [--since 2026-09-01] [--limit 10]
  uzjobs.py ad --id 33951

**One request to the feed the site links returns 21 advertisements complete** —
identifier, title, employer, both ends of the posting period, region and
salary — with no page fetched at all.

THE «GIBBERISH» IS GONE, AND THE REASON MATTERS

Uzbekistan's country page recorded, on 2026-09-04: *«le site répond 200 et rend
du charabia»*, with a redirect chain declaring `iso-8859-1`, then nothing, then
`windows-1251`, and **no charset in the HTML**.

Measured 2026-09-08:

    GET /             200 · no redirect · Content-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1251
    charset_of()      'windows-1251', from the header
    decode_body()     windows-1251 → clean XHTML, <title>UzJobs …</title>

**There is no chain today: the requested URL is the final URL, and the one
declaration is right.** *Whether the site changed or the earlier reading
followed a hop that no longer happens, this card cannot say* — it reports what
one request returns now, and the country page's verdict is retired rather than
contradicted.

**Everything on this host is `windows-1251`** — the HTML, and the feed, which
declares it in its XML prologue. `_decode.decode_body` is given the headers and
picks it up; nothing here is decoded by hand.

THE FEED IS THE INVENTORY THIS MODULE READS, AND IT IS NOT THE BOARD

`/rss_vak.cgi` is linked from the home page and from the vacancy list. It
returns **21 items**, and every field this adapter emits comes from them:

    <guid>/<link>   https://uzjobs.uz/r/vakansy_view-33951.html
    <title>         Вакансия: Руководитель инфраструктурных проектов
    <pubDate>       Mon, 07 Sep 2026 10:51:52 +0500
    <description>   Компания: …<br><br>Период размещения: 07.09.2026 - 06.10.2026
                    <br><br>Регион: Ташкент<br><br>Предлагаемая зарплата: …

**21 is the feed's window, not the board's size.** The vacancy list shows ten
per page with identifiers running to 33951, and its pagination goes through a
form `POST`ing to `/vakansy.cgi` with `raz`, `lan`, `search`, `keyword`, `go`
and the selects `sfera1`, `sfera2`, `pol`, `obraz`, `zanyat`, `region`.

*That form was not exercised.* **Those names are written down here so the next
session does not rediscover them**, and so that nobody mistakes 21 for a count
of anything but the feed.

THE DATE IS THE SITE'S OWN, AND THERE ARE TWO OF THEM

`Период размещения: 07.09.2026 - 06.10.2026` — **the posting period carries
both ends**, so `posted` and `expires` come from the advertisement rather than
from a file's timestamp. `pubDate` agrees with the first on every item
measured, and is parsed with `email.utils` rather than sliced: *an RFC-822 date
compared as a string sorts «Fri 04 Sep» after «Wed 02 Sep», which is how a
first probe of this feed reported its range backwards.*

THIS BOARD PUBLISHES AGE AND GENDER REQUIREMENTS, AND THIS MODULE DOES NOT

An advertisement page carries `Возраст: 30-45 лет`, and the site's own search
form offers `pol` — gender — beside education and employment type.

**Neither is emitted, and no filter is offered on either** — issue #183,
2026-09-08. *Uzbekistan's Labour Code, new edition, law No. ZRU-798 of
2022-10-28 in force since 2023-04-01, admits no employment restriction founded
on age or sex.* **So the criterion does not travel through this module.**

**The advertisement is still served.** *Dropping the advertisements that carry
such a requirement would deny a candidate a real vacancy — the opposite of the
point.* **It is the criterion that does not propagate, not the vacancy.**

**The Code reserves factors «&nbsp;related to the exercise of the
occupation&nbsp;», so a requirement CAN be lawful in narrow cases** — and this
module cannot decide, advertisement by advertisement, whether a given one falls
inside that reserve. *Faced with that, not propagating is the safe conduct.*

**`Возраст` is still known to the parser**, moved to `OTHER_LABELS`: a label
this module does not emit must still be known, so that the value before it is
cut at the right place.

**The claim first written here was that dropping the label would append the age
to `category`. That was not measured, and it is not true of the pages read.**
*Removing `Возраст` from every label set and re-reading four advertisements
changed **zero fields** — the pages put `Возраст` where no emitted value is cut
by it.* **The label is kept as a precaution against a page order we have not
seen, and that is a weaker reason than the one first given here** — written
down because a docstring that overstates its own mechanism is how the next
reader is misled.

**This is per jurisdiction.** *The Uzbek Code says nothing about anywhere else,
and this change is not a template for other adapters.*
