"""Fetch Spanish ads from Empléate — the SEPE's national job board.

**28 099 live ads**, the first Spanish board in this repository and the third
national public employment service after `job-room.md` (CH) and
`france-travail.md` (FR). One request returns **100 complete ads, full text
included**: there is no per-ad fetch, which makes this the cheapest board here
per ad.

  GET /robots.txt                                → Allow: /, six private paths closed
  GET /empleate/open/offersearch/selectBuscador  → Solr, open, no key
  https://empleate.gob.es/empleo/#/oferta/<id>   → the ad, for a human

**No browser, no account, no key.** `robots.txt` closes only the logged-in
areas — `/empleo/perfil/`, `/empleo/empresas/` — and names no crawler at all.

Everything below was measured against the live index on 2026-09-01.

THREE WAYS THIS ENDPOINT LIES QUIETLY. All three answer HTTP 200.

1. **Omit `fq` and you get 131 510 ads, of which 103 411 are dead.** The
   server injects the live filter `(speStateId:1 OR speStateId:4)` only when
   the request already carries an `fq` — with none, it applies none, and
   returns the whole index including every expired and withdrawn ad. Four
   times the board, well-formed, no warning. This adapter therefore always
   sends an `fq` and **verifies the injection came back** in
   `responseHeader.params.fq`; see `check_live_filter`.

2. **`FAIL!` is a 200 with `Content-type: application/json`.** A five-byte
   body that is not JSON. It is what the endpoint returns for an `fq` its
   validator rejects — an unquoted value containing a space
   (`comunidadF:CASTILLA LEON`), or any clause mentioning `speStateId`
   alongside another. A client that treats a parse failure as "no results"
   reports an empty board. Values are quoted here, `speStateId` is never sent,
   and a non-JSON body is a hard error.

3. **`rows` is capped at 100 in silence.** Ask for 1 000 and the response
   echoes `"rows":"100"` and carries 100 docs. A client paging `start += 1000`
   while receiving 100 reads **10% of the board** and reports a full sweep.
   Paging here advances by the number of documents actually returned.

A fourth, of a rarer species: **`url:"#"` matches all 28 099 ads.** SNE ads
store the literal `"#"` in `url`, which tokenises to nothing, so the clause is
a no-op that reads like a precise filter. The usual sitemap failure returns
zero; this one returns everything.

WHAT THE BOARD IS. Thirteen feeds, not one. SNE (9 819) is the regional
employment services, INSERTIA (7 235) and COGITI (3 285) are partner networks,
WEB (2 319) is Empléate's own direct-application ads. **TECNO_EMPLEO (2 436) is
Tecnoempleo**, whose own `robots.txt` refuses six Anthropic agents and which
`shared/robots-policy.md` rules out entirely. Reading it *here* is reading a
Spanish public register, not tecnoempleo.com — but the ad's `url` field points
back at that host, so this adapter never emits it as the ad URL and marks it
`source_url_do_not_fetch`. The full text is in the record regardless.

AGE. "Live" on this board means "not withdrawn", not "still hiring": **8 106 of
28 099 (29%) were posted over a year ago, 4 326 over three**, the oldest in
2020. Every run reports that split for what it returned. `--desde` is a
correctness control here, not an optimisation.

Usage:
  empleate.py provincias
  empleate.py fuentes
  empleate.py search --provincia MADRID --desde 2026-08-01
  empleate.py search --texto "desarrollador java" --limit 40
  empleate.py discover --comunidad "CATALUÑA" --desde 2026-08-25

Output: one JSON object per line.
