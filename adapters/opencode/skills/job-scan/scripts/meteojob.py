"""Fetch job ads from meteojob.com, a French generalist board.

Meteojob is one of France's larger generalist boards, and it also feeds France
Travail — 30 of 150 sampled partner ads in Paris came from it. This adapter
reads the ads on Meteojob itself, where the employer is named and the ad
carries a stated expiry date, neither of which survives the France Travail
route.

**Read `shared/boards/meteojob.md` before changing anything here.** The site's
robots.txt disallows `/api/` and `/jobsearch/api/`, and disallows every
query-string URL except an explicit `Allow: /jobs?*`. So this adapter uses
`/jobs?what=&where=` and `/jobs/<id>` and nothing else — which costs it
pagination, because pages 2+ exist only behind the disallowed API. **One search
is 20 ads, and that is the whole board this adapter can see.** Never add a call
to `/jobsearch/api/` to get past it; run more, narrower searches instead.

Usage:
  meteojob.py search --what "infirmier" --where "Lyon"
  meteojob.py search --what "développeur" --where "Paris" --with-detail
  meteojob.py ad <id>

Output: one JSON object per line (search), or one JSON object (ad).
