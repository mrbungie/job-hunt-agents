"""Fetch Spanish public-sector announcements from Empléate — oposiciones.

The second index behind `empleate.gob.es`, and a different board from
`empleate.py` in every way that matters. **1 558 live announcements**, ~3 438
posts, from `open/publicoffersearch/selectBuscador`.

  GET /empleate/open/publicoffersearch/selectBuscador   → Solr, open, no key
       ?q=*&wt=json&rows=100&fq=speStateId:1
  https://empleate.gob.es/empleo/#/trabajoPublico?search=<id>   → the ad

**No browser, no account, no key.** Same `robots.txt` as the sibling: nine
lines, `Allow: /`, six logged-in paths closed, no crawler named.

Everything below was measured against the live index on 2026-09-01.

THE FIELD THAT NAMES THE DEADLINE IS A CONSTANT. `estadoPlazoF` reads
**"Abierto" on all 76 050 records** — including the 74 492 the same index marks
`Inactiva`, and including announcements whose closing date passed in 2025. It
is not a status; it is a string that is always there.

On a board of competitive examinations that is the whole object. Nobody applies
to an oposición they cannot enter. So the closing date is **computed from
`fechaPresentacion` and never read from `estadoPlazo`** — and the arithmetic is
not academic: **498 of the 1 558 live announcements (32%) have a deadline that
has already passed**, every one of them stamped "Abierto".

By default this adapter drops them and says how many it dropped.
`--incluir-cerradas` keeps them, marked.

THE SIBLING'S HABIT RETURNS AN EMPTY BOARD HERE. `empleate.py` relies on the
server injecting `(speStateId:1 OR speStateId:4)` whenever a request carries
any `fq`, and sends `checkVisible:1` for the sole purpose of triggering it.

**This endpoint injects nothing, and has no `checkVisible` field.** The same
call returns:

  publicoffersearch  fq=checkVisible:1  → 0 ads, echoed back unchanged
  publicoffersearch  fq=speStateId:1    → 1 558
  publicoffersearch  no fq              → 76 050, of which 74 492 inactive

Two adjacent endpoints on one host with opposite contracts, and neither
announces which it is. Here the live filter is **ours to supply** — there is no
safety net, and forgetting it returns 98% dead records rather than the 79% the
sibling would. So it is asserted in the echoed parameters on every response.

*(The same divergence runs the other way too: `fq=comunidadF:CASTILLA LEON`,
unquoted, answers `FAIL!` on the sibling and 1 509 here. Values are quoted
regardless.)*

IT IS NOT A NATIONAL BOARD IN PRACTICE. 1 334 of the 1 558 live records come
from **CIDO**, the Diputació de Barcelona's register, and **1 291 of the 1 391
that carry a province are Catalan** — Barcelona 965, Tarragona 161, Girona 104,
Lleida 61. Madrid has 42. The index is national; what is live in it is Catalan
local government. Every run says so.

AND THERE IS NO AD TEXT. `contenido` is one line — median **118 characters**,
longest 289. What the record carries is the title, the hiring body, the
civil-service group, the access route and the date. The notice itself lives on
`cido.diba.cat` or `administracion.gob.es`. `cover-letter` will have nothing to
read here and should be told so rather than left to invent.

Usage:
  oposiciones.py provincias
  oposiciones.py organismos --provincia BARCELONA
  oposiciones.py search --provincia BARCELONA --grupo A1
  oposiciones.py search --desde 2026-08-01 --dias-restantes 7
