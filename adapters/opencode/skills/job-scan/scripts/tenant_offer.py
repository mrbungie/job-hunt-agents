"""An ad points at an ATS the user already sweeps — under a tenant they never
configured. Read it off the URL and offer it.

**Issue #83.** A HiringCafe card carried

    apply_url = https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Evooq/744000146883069-…

`smartrecruiters` was **already enabled** in that config, with three tenants.
`Evooq` was not one of them. The provider is in the host, the tenant is the
first path segment, **and nothing read either** — the deduction was made by
hand and the line typed into the config.

A second case the same day, on a different board and a different provider:
SICPA on jobup, `jobs.sicpa.com`, a SuccessFactors tenant, while
`successfactors` was enabled for another host entirely.

WHY READING IT BEATS GUESSING IT. `shared/boards/smartrecruiters.md` records
that **a wrong tenant answers 200 with zero ads**. So a tenant cannot be
guessed and confirmed by probing — the only safe way to add one is **to have
seen it on a real advert**, which is exactly what this produces. The
repository's own warning, turned into the feature.

FOLLOW THE REDIRECTS BEFORE READING THE HOST. jobup publishes SICPA's
`externalUrl` as `sicpa.contactrh.com`, which is **a 302 with a zero-byte body**
to `career012.successfactors.eu` and then to `jobs.sicpa.com`. An
implementation that reads the provider off the URL as published concludes
*"contactrh, unknown provider"* and misses a perfectly identifiable tenant.
`jobs-ch.md` already listed `contactrh.com` among the hosts it sees — without
saying it was a redirector.

WHAT THIS NEVER DOES:

- **It never writes the config.** It prints what it saw and what would be
  added. The file is the user's, and the offer rides in a question already
  being asked — the same constraint as issue #80.
- **It never offers a tenant it has not confirmed.** A provider whose wrong
  tenants answer 200-and-empty makes an unverified offer worse than silence.
- **It never guesses a provider.** A host it does not recognise is reported as
  `unknown` with the host named, not silently dropped: a URL nobody could read
  is a fact worth seeing.
