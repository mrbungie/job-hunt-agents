"""Read one employer's Solique job portal.

Solique is an ATS, not a board: one employer per tenant, no search across
employers. Public HTML and JSON, unauthenticated, **no browser**.

The awkward part is that Solique does not have one architecture, it has three,
and which one a tenant uses is invisible until you ask:

  1. <tenant>/<lang>/ajax/           JSON  — complete board  (e.g. iss, 105 ads)
  2. <tenant>/<lang>/api/v1/data/    JSON  — complete board  (e.g. ktzh, 177)
  3. <tenant>/                       HTML  — PARTIAL board, and unpageable
                                            (ottosag serves 25 of a stated 157)

`list` tries them in that order and always says which route answered and how
complete it is. **Route 3 is never a full board** — see --help of `list`.

Usage:
  solique.py list  --tenant iss [--lang de] [--search projet]
  solique.py ad    --tenant iss --id 4061853
  solique.py check --tenant iss --id 4061853
