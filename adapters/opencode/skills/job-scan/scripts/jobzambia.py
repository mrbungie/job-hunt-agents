"""Job Zambia — dated at the listing, undated at the end.

    jobzambia.py list [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--fetch] [--limit N]
    jobzambia.py ad --slug corporate-social-investment-officer

`--live` IS REFUSED HERE, AND THE REFUSAL WAS MEASURED

Its sibling `jobsearchzm.py` implements `--live`. This one cannot: **twelve
advertisements were read on 2026-09-05 and none of the twelve carried a
`validThrough`.** So the option is refused rather than accepted and left
without effect.

*A `--live` that never drops anything is indistinguishable from a board on
which nothing expires.* The first reading of this board saw one advertisement
without an end date; one observation would not have justified wiring a refusal,
so twelve were read before this line was written.

`--since` IS IMPLEMENTED, AND FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON

The sitemap carries `<lastmod>` on every entry — **18 distinct dates over 45
advertisements, heaviest day 4** — so the filter is answered from the listing
and opens no page.

THE SHAPES, MEASURED BEFORE THE CODE WAS WRITTEN

Identical to its sibling and different from `gozambiajobs`, which is why
neither was assumed:

    jobLocation.address   a STRING — "Lusaka, Zambia" — not a PostalAddress,
                          and sometimes a list of four towns in one string
    employmentType        a LIST — ["FULL_TIME"]
    title                 DOUBLE-escaped: "&amp;#8211;" for an en dash

**Every free-text field is unescaped, not only the title** — the control that
checked `title` alone printed a raw entity in `town` on the line above its own
green assertion.
