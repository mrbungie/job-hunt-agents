"""Discover job ads on welcometothejungle.com — sitemap side only.

**This script does half the job, and the half it does not do needs the user's
Chrome.** Read `shared/boards/wttj.md` before using it.

  discovery  →  this script, plain HTTP, sanctioned by robots.txt
  reading    →  the browser, because every HTML page answers a WAF challenge

**Every HTML page on this site answers `HTTP 202` with the header
`x-amzn-waf-action: challenge`** — an AWS WAF challenge. Not a 403, not a block
page: a 2xx status with a 2 450-byte body that contains no ad. Slowing down does
not help; measured, one request every 6 s and one every 12 s were challenged 10
times out of 10. So this script **never requests an ad page**, and would be
lying if it did.

What it does instead is the part the site invites: `robots.txt` publishes a
sitemap index, and the sitemaps are served to a plain client without challenge.
Nine files of 10 000 URLs, **88 222 ads**, each with a real per-ad `lastmod`.

  GET /robots.txt                              → Sitemap: …/sitemaps/index.xml.gz
  GET /sitemaps/index.xml.gz                   → 24 sitemaps, 9 of job listings
  GET /sitemaps/job-listings.<n>.xml.gz        → 10 000 ad URLs + lastmod

Usage:
  wttj.py sitemaps
  wttj.py discover --locale fr --since 2026-08-25
  wttj.py discover --company carrefour
  wttj.py companies --top 30

Output: one JSON object per line — a URL and what can be known without
fetching it. Hand those URLs to the browser step.
