"""Fetch job ads from a Cegid Talentsoft careers site.

Talentsoft (Cegid) runs the careers sites of large French employers and public
bodies — ministries, airports, energy, publishing. It is the fifth and last of
the French ATS family here, after `taleez.md`, `flatchr.md`, `softy.md` and
`digitalrecruiters.md`.

Careers sites live at `https://<tenant>.talent-soft.com/`, where the tenant
label usually ends in `-recrute` or `-career`. Everything is **server-rendered
ASP.NET** — no JSON anywhere, and no JSON-LD either — so this parses HTML.

What makes that tolerable: the ad pages carry Talentsoft's **field model as
element ids** (`fldjobdescription_jobtitle`, `fldlocation_joblocation`, …).
Those come from the platform, not from a theme, so they hold across tenants and
across restyling — unlike the utility classes on `softy.md` and `cadremploi.md`.

Usage:
  talentsoft.py jobs --tenant businessfrance-recrute
  talentsoft.py jobs --tenant businessfrance-recrute --with-detail
  talentsoft.py ad --tenant businessfrance-recrute --path /offre-de-emploi/...aspx

Output: one JSON object per line (jobs), or one JSON object (ad).
