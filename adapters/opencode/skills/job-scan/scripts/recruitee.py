"""Read one employer's board from Recruitee — a salary on more than half the
ads, and a country field written in the tenant's own language.

Recruitee is a European ATS (Dutch, now part of Tellent) used across the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland and beyond. Each tenant publishes its
whole board as public JSON:

  GET https://<tenant>.recruitee.com/api/offers/   → every published offer
  https://<tenant>.recruitee.com/o/<slug>          → the ad, for a human

**No browser, no account, no key.** One request returns the employer's entire
board with descriptions — 145 offers in one 454 KB response on the largest
tenant measured. `robots.txt` is two lines and closes only `/v/`; the API path
is not disallowed and no crawler or AI agent is named.

Measured on **238 offers across six tenants** on 2026-09-01.

IT PAYS BETTER THAN MOST BOARDS HERE, AND THE UNIT IS THE TRAP. `salary` is an
object on **238 of 238** — so a presence check reports full coverage, the shape
`platsbanken.md` and `turijobs.md` both punish — but unlike those two it is
often real: **133 of 238 carry an actual figure**, which is better than every
national board in this repository except SwissDevJobs.

    "salary": {"min": "2990", "max": "3992", "period": "month", "currency": "EUR"}

**`period` is `month` on 124 of the 133, `hour` on 6 and `year` on 1**, and two
carry figures with no period at all. A monthly Dutch salary read as an annual
one is wrong by a factor of twelve — the same class of error as `join.md`'s
minor units and `arbeitsagentur.md`'s hourly rates. The period is emitted
beside every figure and never assumed.

THE COUNTRY IS WRITTEN IN THE TENANT'S LANGUAGE, AND THE VALUES MIX. Across one
sweep of six tenants:

    Nederland 231 · Frankrijk 2 · Duitsland 2 · Switzerland 1 ·
    Oostenrijk 1 · Denemarken 1

Five Dutch names and one English one, in the same result set. A filter written
`country == "Germany"` matches nothing, and `country == "Netherlands"` matches
nothing either. **`country_code` is on 238 of 238 and is the only reliable
one**; the localised string is carried beside it as `country_label` so nobody
mistakes it for a key.

REMOTE, HYBRID AND ON-SITE ARE THREE BOOLEANS AND THEY OVERLAP.

    on_site only            120
    hybrid only              67
    hybrid AND on_site       49
    remote AND on_site        1
    remote AND hybrid AND on_site   1

They are not an enum and cannot be collapsed into one. Reading `remote` alone
misses the 49 that are hybrid-and-on-site; treating them as mutually exclusive
misclassifies 51 of 238. All three are emitted, plus a `work_model` list, and
never a single value.

Usage:
  recruitee.py jobs --tenant gmk
  recruitee.py jobs --tenant ballastnedam --country-code NL
  recruitee.py tenants --country NL      (finds tenants through HiringCafe)

Output: one JSON object per line.
