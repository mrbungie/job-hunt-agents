"""Read one employer's Haufe/Abacus umantis career site.

umantis is an ATS, not a board: each employer runs its own site, either at
recruitingapp-<n>.umantis.com or behind a vanity domain of their own
(jobs.<employer>.com). There is no search across employers, so this script
targets one employer at a time — the same shape as workday.py and ats.py.

Two paths carry everything, and both answer unauthenticated even when the site
root is gated by SSO:

  /Jobs                                  the listing
  /Vacancies/<id>/Description/<segment>  one vacancy, full text

The segment is NOT a constant. It varies per vacancy inside a single tenant,
so it is read from the listing and never guessed. See --help of `ad`.

There is deliberately no `resolve` command: HiringCafe indexes no umantis ad
(0 of 771 Swiss ads), so the trick that finds tenants for Workday, Greenhouse,
Lever and Ashby does not work here. The user supplies the careers URL, or it
arrives as the externalUrl of a jobup / job-room / jobs.ch row.

Usage:
  umantis.py list  --host jobs.bobst.com [--search product]
  umantis.py ad    --host jobs.bobst.com --id 9151 [--segment 2]
  umantis.py check --host jobs.bobst.com --id 9151     # open / not open
