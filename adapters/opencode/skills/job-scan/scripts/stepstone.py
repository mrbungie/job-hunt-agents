"""Fetch ads from the StepStone platform — eleven domains, six inventories, one
result list that pads itself with ads that do not match.

One application serves Totaljobs, Jobsite, Caterer, CWJobs, IrishJobs, NIJobs,
Jobs.ie and StepStone DE/AT/BE/NL. They run **the same bundle** (`client-bundle.js`,
v4.107.0 on 2026-09-02), the same design system (`data-genesis-element`), the
same card contract (`data-at="job-item"`) and the same ad markup, and they are
told apart by one number — `siteId`, in `window.__PRELOADED_STATE__.header`.

  GET /jobs/<keyword>                     → the result list, 25 cards, HTTP 200
  GET /jobs/<keyword>/in-<place>          → the same, narrowed by location
  GET /jobs/<keyword>?page=<n>            → page n, where the site allows it
  GET /job/x/y-job<id>                    → the ad (UK/IE), slug ignored
  GET /stellenangebote--x--<id>-inline.html → the ad (StepStone), slug ignored

**No browser, no account, no key** — but two constraints that decide the code.

THE COUNT ON THE PAGE IS NOT THE COUNT OF ADS THAT MATCH. Every result list
carries an analytics payload, `data-atx-onpageview-payload`, and it breaks its
own total down:

    stepstone.nl  "software developer"  total:26   main:1    semantic:25
    stepstone.be  "software developer"  total:607  main:110  semantic:497
    stepstone.at  "softwareentwickler"  total:519  main:248  semantic:271
    stepstone.de  "softwareentwickler"  total:4962 main:4892 semantic:70
    totaljobs     "software developer"  total:3786 main:3785 semantic:1
    irishjobs     "software developer"  total:408  main:408  semantic:0

**`semantic` is the platform's own word for ads it decided were related.** On
stepstone.nl, 25 of the 26 results for "software developer" are that — the
board holds **one** literal match and serves a full page of 25 cards anyway.
Nothing in the visible list separates the two populations, and the payload
gives counts, not per-card attribution. Adding a location adds a third:
`regional`, 796 of 1 862 on Totaljobs "software developer in-london".

So every command here prints the split, and `search` refuses to stay quiet when
the padding is the majority. The honest reading of a page is *main*, and *main*
is not what you counted.

THE OTHER CONSTRAINT IS THE TRANSPORT. A request to this platform can fail
**with no HTTP status at all** — `HTTP/2 stream not closed cleanly:
INTERNAL_ERROR`, or a read timeout. It hits cold ad-page requests over HTTP/2,
and it hits any host after a burst. It is not a 429, not a 403, and not a page:
a client that reads "no status" as a network blip will retry for ever.

`urllib` speaks HTTP/1.1 only, which is why this script does not see the first
form. It still sees the second, so it retries **once**, slowly, and then stops
and says the sweep was truncated. Never loop.

Everything here was verified against the live sites on **2026-09-02**.
