# Job scan → pipeline ledger

Sweep a job board in the user's logged-in Chrome, score each ad against their
real profile, and write the results into the **ledger** that the `cover-letter`
skill reads and updates.

**Shared references — read the ones a step points to, not all of them up front.**
They live in this plugin, one level above this skill's folder
(`../../shared/…`, or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/…`):

| File | When |
| :-- | :-- |
| `shared/never-fail-silently.md` | **Always.** The rule that outranks the others: nothing skipped, partial or guessed goes unreported — and nothing learned that would be true for another user stays local |
| `shared/workspace.md` | Step 0 — locating and loading the user's data |
| `shared/setup.md` | Step 0 — only when the workspace is not configured |
| `shared/prerequisites.md` | Any step whose tool is missing — how to help the user fix it |
| `shared/boards/README.md` | Step 2 — which boards are supported and what an adapter owes the skill |
| `shared/boards/<board>.md` | Steps 2–4 — the adapter for each board enabled under `boards:` in `config.yml` |
| `shared/plausible-and-false.md` | Step 5 — before a number is scored on: what a field measures, and why plausibility is not a check |
| `shared/reading-terms.md` | Step 2 — how a board's terms of use are read, and what that reading never licenses |
| `shared/search-language.md` | Steps 2–4 — which language to ask a market in, and what a zero from a multilingual market does *not* prove |
| `shared/scoring-rubric.md` | Step 5 — scoring, and the commute filter |
| `shared/pipeline-format.md` | Steps 0 and 6 — the ledger's format and merge rules |
| `shared/new-achievements.md` | Step 6b — the monthly question, and why it is never a repository scan |
| `shared/workspace.md` | Steps 0 and 7 — the workspace files, and which one is authoritative about what |
| `shared/browser-handoff.md` | Before any browser action — selecting mcp-chrome's profile and the mandatory human gates |
| `shared/modules/*.md` | Step 6 — only those enabled in `config.yml` |

**When a board with an adapter fails to sweep, invoke the `board-request` skill**
(broken-adapter mode, its section 2b) before the run ends — the fix belongs
upstream, where it reaches every user, not in a local workaround that the next
plugin update overwrites.

**And a failed sweep is not the only thing that goes upstream — it is the rarest
of them.** `shared/never-fail-silently.md`, *What you learn belongs to the next
user too*, holds the standing rule: **anything this run learns that would be
true for another user of this plugin goes upstream**, through `board-request`
section **2c**. An adapter that returned the *wrong* ads, a site whose `200`
means no, a date that turned out to be a re-listing, a script defect, a method
that was wrong. Apply its one test — *would this still be true on another
machine, for another person, tomorrow?* — and if the answer is no, it belongs in
this run's output and nowhere else. **File it after the scan is reported, never
in the middle of it.**

**When a prerequisite is missing at any point, do not stop at saying so.**
Follow `shared/prerequisites.md`: name what it blocks, give the exact command
for the user's platform, offer to run it, verify, and fall back gracefully if
they decline.

## Which boards

**The list lives here and not in the description**, because the description is
two things at once: **the card a public catalogue shows, and what decides
whether this skill is reached at all.** Seventy site names were illegible in
the first and diluted the second. Issue #113.

**`shared/boards/README.md` is the register** — one row per adapter, what it
needs, and what it costs. The short version, by kind:

**No board is scanned until the user switches it on**, and `/job-setup boards`
is where that happens.

## 0 — Load the workspace, then the ledger (always first)

```bash
JOB_HUNT_HOME="${JOB_HUNT_HOME:-$HOME/Documents/job_applications}"
test -f "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/config.yml" && cat "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/config.yml"
S="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/skills/job-scan/scripts"
python3 "$S/ledger.py" count                    # rows, and where the bytes are
python3 "$S/ledger.py" index --excluded-only    # the exclusion set: id + status
python3 "$S/ledger.py" rows --status todo       # the only rows this run edits
```

**Do not `cat` the ledger.** Measured on a real one, 2026-09-02: 499 320 bytes,
of which **`## Log` is 40% and nothing consults it to decide anything**, and
the `Note` column is **78.5% of the ads table** and is prose for the person,
never parsed. What step 0 decides — *which ids are never proposed again* —
needs `ID` and `Status`: **16 531 bytes, 3.3% of the file.** Reading the whole
thing spends a hundred thousand tokens to answer a question worth three
thousand.

**And `\|` inside a cell is an escaped pipe, not a column break.** Ten of those
474 rows carry one; splitting a row on `|` shifts every column after it and
produces a wrong *status*, which means an ad silently re-proposed or silently
buried. `ledger.py` handles it — an `awk` one-liner does not. Issue #77.

**Then, once, quietly:**

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/bin/version-check.py"
```

**It prints nothing when the workspace is current**, which is the normal case
— no version line, no reassurance. When a newer release exists it prints one
short block naming the release and the host commands that fetch it. **Pass it
on as it is and carry on with the task**: updating is the host's action, the
plugin changes nothing, and a job hunt is not interrupted for a version
number. The answer is cached for a day, and every failure — no network, a rate
limit, a timeout — is silence. Issue #79.

**No `config.yml` → this is a first run.** Say so in one line, then follow
`shared/setup.md` in full before scanning anything. Do not improvise a profile
and do not scan with defaults: a scan built on guesses produces a ledger the
user has to clean by hand.

**No ledger file** → create it from `templates/job-pipeline.example.md`.

Then build the **exclusion set**: every `ID` in the ledger whose status is
`applied`, `rejected`, `no-go` or `discarded`. Those are never proposed again —
`index --excluded-only` is exactly that list. Rows still `todo` stay in the
file and get refreshed in place rather than duplicated, and `rows --status
todo` gives them in full because those are the ones a run rewrites.

**Note the row count from `count` before you write anything, and take the
file's fingerprint.** Step 6 checks both:

```bash
LEDGER_STAMP=$(python3 "$S/ledger.py" stamp)
```

`verify --before <n>` refuses a ledger that came back with fewer rows than it
went in with, and `stamp --expect` refuses to write over **another session's
work** — three live sessions were counted against one workspace on 2026-09-01,
and the second writer's copy silently drops every row the first one added
(issue #56).

**Build a second index at the same time: company name → existing rows.** The id
check alone is not enough, because **the same ad carries a different id on every
board**, and boards rename the employer as they please. Keep the company strings
from the ledger to hand; step 3 matches new cards against them.

## 1 — Load the candidate

```bash
# -l 3 = first 3 pages. Do not pipe into `head`: it is the same SIGPIPE trap
# that silently truncated sync-sources.sh, and page count is what you want here.
for f in "$JOB_HUNT_HOME"/profile/*.pdf; do pdftotext -layout -l 3 "$f" -; done
cat "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/candidate.md"
cat "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/repos.md" 2>/dev/null
cat "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/commute.md" 2>/dev/null
```

What matters for scoring: core stack, seniority, leadership history, working
languages, and home base. `candidate.md` also carries the **hard blockers** and
the current **search posture** — read them before deciding what counts as a good
ad, not afterwards.

Home base and the commute limit come from `config.yml` (`location.home_base`,
`location.max_commute_minutes`). Every distance in this skill is measured from
there.

## 2 — Resolve the boards, then set up the browser

`config.yml` → `boards` says which job boards may be swept. **Nothing is
enabled by default and an unconfigured workspace scans nothing** — scanning
drives the user's own browser under their own account, so it only ever touches
a site they explicitly switched on.

**No board enabled → do not scan anything.** Say so in one line, list the
adapters that exist (`shared/boards/`), say what each needs, and offer to
enable one now (`/job-setup boards`). Do not pick a default, and do not scan
"just LinkedIn since it's the common one".

Then give the user the route that works right now, because there is one:
*"you can also just hand me an ad URL from any board — `/cover-letter <URL>` —
and I'll score it and write the documents without any of this."* Never leave
them at a dead end because a board is not configured.

For each board that *is* enabled, read its adapter — `shared/boards/<board>.md`
— **before the first browser call.** The adapter owns its config keys, the URL
recipe, the card extraction, the description reading and the ad-URL rebuild;
this skill owns the scoring, the ledger and the reporting.

- **Enabled but a required setting is empty** → skip that board, name the
  missing key, say how to obtain it, and offer to fill it now. **Never
  half-run** a board on a guessed value.
- **Enabled with no adapter file** → skip it and say so plainly: *"there is no
  adapter for <board> yet, so I can't sweep it automatically — give me an ad
  URL from it and `cover-letter` will do the rest."* Guessing at an untested
  site's markup returns nothing, or the wrong ads, with no way for the user to
  tell. See `shared/boards/README.md`.
- **Adapter present but the board fails anyway** — the search page loads and
  nothing extracts, a selector no longer matches, a login wall or consent gate
  appeared, the URL recipe 404s → **skip that board, keep sweeping the others,
  and invoke the `board-request` skill in its broken-adapter mode (its section
  2b) before the run ends.** Capture the symptom while the browser is still on
  the page; a failure reconstructed afterwards is a guess.

  **A board that broke for this user broke for everyone.** Working around it
  locally is half the job — the issue is what turns one broken scan into a fix
  that ships to every user on the next plugin update. `board-request` handles
  the duplicate check, the privacy pass on search URLs and page dumps, and the
  submission; do not hand-roll any of it here.

  Do **not** file for an anti-bot challenge that the adapter already documents
  as expected (`indeed.md` does), for a logged-out session, or for a search that
  genuinely has no results. Section 2b's table separates the three.

### 2a — Dormant boards: the ones switched off on evidence, not on principle

**Run this once, at the same time as reading `config.yml`:**

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/job-scan/scripts/dormant.py" due \
  --config "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/config.yml"
```

It prints one JSON object per board whose re-check date has passed, and usually
prints nothing at all — which is the normal case and is not an error.

**Never work out those dates yourself.** *"Has 2026-11-28 passed?"* is the kind
of question that gets answered confidently and wrongly, and both wrong answers
cost the user something: one nags them about a board they parked last week, the
other silently buries a board that was worth another look.

A board is **dormant**, not off, when `config.yml` carries `dormant_since`
alongside `enabled: false` — see *The fourth state* in `shared/boards/README.md`
for the shape and the reasoning. **A bare `enabled: false` is a hard off: do not
probe it, do not report it, do not mention it.** The user said no.

For each board the script reports as due:

1. **Run one yield check — not a sweep.** One listing call at the adapter's
   cheapest setting, capped. **No descriptions, no scoring beyond title and
   location, and nothing written to the ledger.** A dormant board must stay
   cheap; a re-check that turns into a full sweep is how this feature ends up
   switched off wholesale.
2. **Never probe a browser board on your own.** LinkedIn, jobup, jobs.ch and
   Indeed run in the user's own Chrome under their own account. For those, a
   passed date means *offering* the re-check and waiting for a yes.
3. **Report it as a measurement, next to the one that put it to sleep** — counts
   against counts, so the user is comparing like with like:

   > **umantis (dormant since 2026-08-30)** — parked because the 10 vacancies on
   > `jobs.bobst.com` were all apprenticeships. Today: 14 vacancies, **3 engineering
   > roles**, one *Software Engineer Full Stack* at Mex (~25 min). Wake it up?

4. **Then let the user decide, and write their answer back:**

   | Answer | What to write in `config.yml` |
   | :-- | :-- |
   | Wake it | `enabled: true`, and **remove all four `dormant_*` keys**. Its own configuration was kept, so this is one line plus a deletion — never a fresh setup interview |
   | Leave it asleep | Set `recheck_after` and `recheck_count` to what `dormant.py next --count <current>` returns. The back-off is 90 → 180 → 365 days |
   | Never again | Delete the four `dormant_*` keys and leave `enabled: false`. That is the hard off, and it is silent from then on |

   **Ask before writing, and ask once.** If the user does not answer this run,
   leave the config untouched — an unanswered question is not a snooze, and
   pushing the date out on their silence loses the very signal they were asked
   about.

**A probe that fails is not a probe that found nothing.** Dormancy records that
a board was *empty*; an error, a 404 or a login wall leaves that claim
unverified, not confirmed. Treat it as any other board failure — `board-request`
in its broken-adapter mode — and say plainly in the report that the re-check did
not happen, rather than letting a silent failure read as another empty quarter.

Then the adapter's **prerequisites block**, which is not optional: the user must
be told that this drives their own Chrome through mcp-chrome, that they must
select the profile, and that they must be logged in to the board themselves
first. If mcp-chrome is absent, follow `shared/prerequisites.md`
— help them install it, and offer the no-browser route meanwhile.

**Read that block rather than assuming it.** Most adapters do not drive the
browser at all. `hiringcafe.md`, `job-room.md`, `france-travail.md`, `apec.md`,
`meteojob.md`, `hellowork.md` and the ATS family (`workday.md`,
`greenhouse.md`, `lever.md`, `ashby.md`, `workable.md`, `teamtailor.md`, `swissdevjobs.md`, `taleez.md`, `flatchr.md`, `digitalrecruiters.md`, `talentsoft.md`, `emploi-territorial.md`, `labonnealternance.md`, `jobology.md`, `batiactu.md`, `anefa.md`, `adecco.md`, `randstad-fr.md`, `crit.md`, `hays-fr.md`, `empleate.md`, `oposiciones.md`, `infoempleo.md`, `turijobs.md`, `arbeitsagentur.md`, `jobsireland.md`, `platsbanken.md`, `personio.md`, `recruitee.md`, `pinpoint.md`, `oraclecloud.md`, `stepstone.md`, `mycareersfuture.md`, `kalibrr.md`, `jobup.md`, `jobs-ch.md`, `jobbkk.md`, `adzuna.md`, `computrabajo.md`, `icims.md`, `vieclam24h.md`, `philjobnet.md`) are plain HTTP, and `jobstore.md` is plain HTTP for discovery but needs the browser to read an ad, and need no extension,
no login and no Chrome. Only `linkedin.md`,
`indeed.md`, `cadremploi.md`, `figaro-emploi.md`, `softy.md` and `wttj.md` (for reading; its discovery half is plain HTTP) need the user's own browser — and of those,
only LinkedIn needs them logged in. Announcing requirements a board does not have costs the user a
setup they did not need — and when the extension really is missing, HiringCafe
is a sweep that still runs, not just a fallback to `cover-letter`.

The adapter's constraint table is the difference between a scan that works and
forty wasted round-trips. Read it; do not improvise around it.

## 3 — Run the searches

Take the sweep from `config.yml` → `search.queries`. Each entry becomes one
search on each configured board, built with that adapter's URL recipe from
`keywords`, `location`, `posted_within` and `remote_only`.

Quoting a keyword (`keywords: '"Laravel"'`) makes most boards match it strictly
— four results instead of six hundred of noise. Unquoted keywords are matched
very loosely, so **always sanity-check the titles**.

For each search: `navigate` → wait → extract the cards with the adapter's
snippet.

If the user asked for a different perimeter than the configured one, use theirs
for this run — and offer to save it into `config.yml` if they want it to stick.

### Filter out the noise before spending clicks

Record as `discarded`, **with the reason**, so they are never re-proposed (the
full list is in `shared/pipeline-format.md`):

- Aggregators and repost farms, plus anything in `search.blocklist`.
- Ads whose stack is explicitly foreign to the candidate.
- Anything breaching the commute filter below.
- Anything already in the exclusion set from step 0.
- **Anything whose `duplicate_of` is in that set.** Three adapters publish it
  and this step used to read none of them — see below.
- **Anything the company index from step 0 matches to an existing row for a
  comparable role** — see below.

### Cross-board duplicates: read `duplicate_of` first

**Some boards tell you outright.** `job-room`, `France Travail` and
`La Bonne Alternance` syndicate ads from boards this plugin already sweeps,
and each publishes the other board's own id in the ledger's namespace:

```
  ledger_id     : job-room:<uuid-A>
  duplicate_of  : jobup:<uuid-B>     ← already in the ledger, status `applied`
  source_system : EXTERN
```

**`duplicate_of` is a ledger id.** Testing it against the step 0 exclusion set
is the same set lookup as the `ID` check, and it must be done at step 3, before
scoring. `francetravail.py` says so in its own source: *"When it is set and the
ledger already holds that row, this is the same posting — record it discarded
naming the row."*

**This step used to say the employer's name was the only signal, and that was
false.** On one job-room sweep of 497 rows, **20 offered duplicates went
through** — one of them an ad the ledger already held at status `applied`.
Nothing stopped it until the ledger refused to write an id it already had,
which is *after* it had been scored and listed as a find. The adapter had
published the answer on the same row. #136.

### Two brands, one platform: expand the id before you compare it

**`jobup.ch` and `jobs.ch` are one platform under two names, and they publish
the same posting under the same UUID.** One adapter serves both; the ledger id
is `<brand>:<uuid>`, so the *same advertisement* reaches step 3 as

```
  jobup:5f2c…            already in the ledger, status `applied`
  jobs-ch:5f2c…          "new"
```

**A set lookup on the whole ledger id says these are different, because as
strings they are.** Seven advertisements passed both checks in one morning on
a real scan, one of them the twin of a row already at `applied` — #170.

**The pairing is declared, not remembered.** Both cards carry

```
  <!-- same-postings: jobs-ch.md · the same posting UUID appears on both -->
  <!-- anciennement `shares-platform:` — renommé le 08.09.2026 -->
```

and until #170 **nothing read it**: a test checked the line was well formed and
no code ever asked it a question. *A declaration written, guarded for shape and
never consumed is a step wired end to end that nobody walks.*

**So expand each candidate id across its platform's siblings and test every
form against the step 0 exclusion set:**

```python
from _cards import platform_siblings, same_posting_ids
sibs = platform_siblings(f"{PLUGIN}/shared/boards")
for form in same_posting_ids(row["ledger_id"], sibs):
    if form in seen:                 # the step 0 exclusion set
        discard(row, f"already held as {form}")
```

**This is a third check, not a replacement.** `duplicate_of` catches a board
that names the other board's row; this catches a board that shares the other
board's *identifier space* without naming anything. **They fail on different
things**, which is why both are here.

**Then, and only then, the employer's name.** It is the fallback for boards
that do not declare syndication, and it must be matched **as a substring, in
both directions**, never as an exact cell:

```bash
grep -n "<Company>" "$JOB_HUNT_HOME/job-pipeline.md"
```

**And the employer check has a blind spot `duplicate_of` does not.** For a
syndicated ad, job-room writes the *syndicating board* as the employer —
`Jobup` — while the ledger holds the real employer's legal name. There is no
common substring in either direction, so the fallback cannot fire on exactly
the rows the declaration would have caught. **The two checks fail on different
things, which is why both are here and in this order.**

Boards write the same employer differently, and an exact match fails on either
side of the difference. Both of these were observed on one real scan, on
2026-08-27:

| Board's string | Ledger's string | Why exact matching failed |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Université de Lausanne` | `Université de Lausanne — Centre informatique (DCSR)` | the ledger's is **longer** — the board omits the department |
| `Infomaniak Network SA` | `Infomaniak` | the ledger's is **shorter** — the board adds the legal form |

Three duplicates slipped through that scan, including one for an ad the ledger
had already scored in depth two weeks earlier and one the user had explicitly
frozen. All three were caught later at `cover-letter`'s own duplicate gate —
after the scan had reported them as new finds.

**When a match comes back, do not silently discard it either.** Check whether it
is genuinely the same position: same company *and* comparable role. If it is,
record the new id as `discarded` naming the row it duplicates. If the roles
differ, keep it and say so in `Note` — the same employer advertising two real
openings is normal.

**And when you cannot tell, keep the row and record the doubt** — do not discard
on a suspicion. Write what you suspect and what would settle it into `Note`, and
raise it in the run's report. The decision belongs to the user, and step 7 will
put it to them; a row quietly discarded on a maybe is an opportunity they never
hear about. See *When you suspect a duplicate but cannot confirm one* in
`shared/pipeline-format.md`.

**Read the matched row's `Note` before moving on.** It may carry a standing
decision — a freeze on that employer, a pending application, a reason the
company was set aside — that outranks the score on the new card.

### The commute filter

**An ad requiring physical presence further than `max_commute_minutes` from the
home base is discarded, whatever its score.** Apply it *before* spending clicks
on the description — the card already carries the location and the work mode.
The full rule, including how hybrid and remote-with-distant-HQ are treated and
the two traps that catch everyone, is in `shared/scoring-rubric.md`.

Use `commute.md` for travel times rather than guessing. If it does not exist,
estimate — and offer to generate it once, since the same guesses recur every
week.

When a row already in the ledger breaches the rule, flip it to `discarded` with
the reason on the next run — but **never rewrite an `applied`, `rejected` or
`no-go` row**, those record what actually happened.

## 4 — Read the descriptions of the survivors

The description is only readable through a **real click** on the card — see
`shared/boards/linkedin.md` for the click-by-coordinates procedure and the
extraction snippet. Several clicks on one search page chain in a single
`browser_batch`: one screenshot, then three to six descriptions.

Confirm the extracted title matches the ad you meant to open; the list re-orders
between visits.

## 5 — Score each ad

Use `shared/scoring-rubric.md` — the **same rubric the `cover-letter` skill
uses**, so the numbers stay comparable end to end.

Mark a score **provisional (`~`)** when it comes from the card only, because the
description was not opened. Never present a provisional score as if the ad had
been read.

### A full page is not a page of matches

**A board's reported total is not a match count** — and on the boards measured
it is not always a count of open adverts either. `stepstone.nl` reports 26 for
*software developer*, holds **one**, and serves a full page of 25 cards that
nothing in the markup distinguishes. LinkedIn does it on zero-result searches
with suggestion cards. Others count history, or posts rather than adverts.

**Never report a board's own total as "ads matching you".** Report what was
read and what was kept, and where the board publishes a decomposition — as
StepStone does — pass it on.

**Where an adapter marks its rows** (`_match.py`: `literal`, `semantic?`,
`regional?`), carry the marker into the `Note` and say the share out loud in
the run report: *"12 of 12 rows are flagged as padding rather than matches"*.
**Never drop a row on that verdict** — the test is a literal one and it is
wrong on another language, on a keyword that lives in the description, and on a
location naming a region. It is a lead for the reader, not a filter.

**And say which boards did the marking**, because most do not: today that is
StepStone's family. An unmarked sweep is not a clean one, it is an unmeasured
one. Issue #62, and `shared/plausible-and-false.md` for the class.

### The right to work: flag it here, and never discard for it

`config.yml` may carry `location.work_authorization` — the countries and zones
where the user needs no sponsorship. **With no such key, skip this whole
section**: nothing is flagged and the run behaves as it always did.

```bash
python3 "$S/_workauth.py" --country GB --allowed "CH,EU"
```

When the **employer's** country is outside that list, the ad **keeps its score
and its `todo` status**. This is the one blocker in `shared/scoring-rubric.md`
that is not a filter, and the reason is in that file: a body cannot be in two
places, but **a contract can take two forms** — being employed in London and
invoicing London from here are different legal objects, and the second needs no
permit. Dropping the ad would destroy a real opportunity invisibly.

**The country that matters is the employer's, not the desk's.** *A remote post
with a British employer is still British employment* — the ad that produced
this rule advertised "hybrid and remote working arrangements available", and
the run noticed the word *remote* and stopped at the place of work instead of
climbing to the right to work there.

**Carry it in three places, because a note alone is provably ignored** (see the
next section):

1. **`Note`** — the marker `` `WA:<CC>` ``, which no later run strips.
2. **The shortlist line at step 7**, in the same breath as the score: *"74% —
   GB: local employment excluded, B2B possibly open"*.
3. **The go/no-go gate in `cover-letter`**, where the decision is actually made.

**Never write it as a flat no**, and never as advice: the plugin noticed a
mismatch between two lists, the user owns the paperwork and the decision.
Issue #82.

### A driving licence, when the ad states one — same shape, different field

**Read the description for it, not the card**, and only when a description was
actually opened:

```bash
python3 "$S/_licence.py" --file <ad text> --licence "B" --vehicle yes
```

`location.driving_licence` and `location.own_vehicle` are two fields on
purpose: an ad asks for the capacity to drive, for a car, or for both.
**Neither one ever discards an ad.** Absent from the config is *never asked*,
not *no* — a false "they don't have it" drops an ad wrongly, and the script
returns `ask` rather than a verdict.

- `never-asked` → one line at step 7 and the question at the gate, plus the
  offer to record it once in `config.yml` rather than re-ask it every week.
- `declared-absent` → say it before a dossier is spent. **Unlike the right to
  work there is no second route here** — a licence required is a licence
  required, and there is no equivalent of *"employment excluded, B2B perhaps
  open"*.
- `ambiguous` → the ad named a permit by a letter. **In Switzerland `permis B`
  is a residence permit, not driving category B.** Read the sentence; never
  resolve it by pattern.

**Do not grep for `permis` yourself.** Measured in one workspace: of 13
`permis <word>` matches, **7 are the driving licence, 5 are the work permit —
a different field entirely — and one is the ordinary French past participle**
(*"la recherche a permis de conclure"*). `permis` is also the prefix of
*permissions*, and bare `vehicle` matches this repository's own *employment
vehicle* in 5 of 45 ad files with 0 of them a car. `_licence.py` is an
allow-list of phrases for that reason; on those 45 ads it fires **once, on the
one ad that says it**. Issue #91.

### Business travel, when the ad asks — the same shape, and one difference

```bash
python3 "$S/_travel.py" --file <ad text>          # or import requirement()
```

`location.travel` is **a phrase, not a boolean**, and that is the difference
from the licence. Measured on 49 advertisements, 2026-09-04: **every real
requirement stated an amount** — *"3–4 weeks per year"*, *"on a limited
basis"*, *"déplacements inter-sites sont probables"*. **A yes meets none of
them**: somebody who will travel three weeks a year and somebody who will
travel monthly both answer yes.

**And the amount is read whether the ad writes it in digits or in letters.**
*"Twice a year, for company events for up to two weeks each"* was reported as
*"without saying how much"* until #207: the pattern looked for `\d+`. The
verdict now carries the quantity normalised — `up to 4 weeks/year (2 × 2
weeks per year)` — and quotes the sentence that states it, not the head of a
flattened bullet list.

**So it never blocks, and not even in the licence's weakened sense.** There
`blocker` means *say it before a dossier is spent*; here the verdict is a
question at the gate and the advertisement is never set aside.

- `asked-user-silent` → the ad asks and the workspace says nothing. **Put the
  question, do not guess an answer.**
- `asked-user-answered` → both are shown side by side. **Nothing compares them
  for you** — a degree is not met by a yes, and the reader decides.

**Do not grep for `travel` yourself.** Of 11 matches in that corpus, **six
were not a requirement**: three the employer's *industry*
(`hospitality/travel/property`), one a *benefit* (`prime mobilité douce`, a
cycling allowance — the opposite of business travel), and **one this
plugin's own analysis prose**, written into the workspace by an earlier run
and read back as if an employer had said it. `_licence.py` records the
identical trap. Issue #137.

### A hard blocker found here changes the status, not just the `Note`

Step 3 discards ads whose stack is foreign to the candidate — but it works from
the **card**, before any description is open. When the blocker only becomes
visible in the description you just read, **the row is `discarded`, with the
reason. It does not stay `todo` carrying a warning.**

This is not bookkeeping pedantry. **Both selection paths rank on `Match` alone** —
step 7 here, and `cover-letter` step 1 — so a `todo` row scoring 57 % is proposed
ahead of a clean 52 % one, whatever its `Note` says. A verdict written in a note
and not carried into the status will be ignored, because **the status is what
gets read and the note is what gets skipped.**

Observed on a real ledger on 2026-08-27: two rows — a .NET/C# team lead at 57 %
and a .NET/Azure integration role at 35 % — had been read weeks earlier, had
`bloqueur dur` written in their own notes, and were still `todo`. The 57 % one
was then proposed to the user as a top pick, on its score and its excellent
commute, by a run that had just finished writing the rule about reading notes.

So, at this step:

- **Hard blocker** (the ad's primary backend language, a required certification
  or spoken language the record lacks, whatever `candidate.md` lists) → status
  `discarded`, reason in `Note`, and say so in the report. Do not score it into
  the shortlist.

  **And take that verdict on the SOURCE when the row is a syndicated copy.** A
  copy is a second-rank reading for the tokens that decide: on 2026-09-11 a
  job-room record lost `Node.js` and `Vue.js` from its description — in the
  raw API payload, not in this plugin — while its jobup twin, the board
  job-room itself names in `duplicate_of`, kept both; `Node.js` was the hard
  blocker, and read on the copy alone the row went to `todo` with a question
  instead of `discarded`. *One ad, two tokens — and nothing in a list with a
  hole says a token is missing.* **So when `duplicate_of` names a source board
  and the verdict turns on the text — stack, language, certification,
  eligibility — open the description at the source before deciding.** The
  field is already in hand from step 3. `shared/boards/job-room.md`, trap 7,
  issue #205.
- **Partial gap** → keep it `todo` and score it honestly. That is what the score
  is for.
- **An open question rather than a verdict** — a contract form to clarify, a
  description not yet read — stays `todo`, and the `Note` says what has to be
  answered *before* drafting. This is the one case where a note may legitimately
  carry the word "blocker" on a `todo` row, and it reads as a question, not a
  conclusion.

## 6 — Write the ledger

Merge, don't overwrite — the rules are in `shared/pipeline-format.md`. Keep
every existing row, refresh `todo` rows in place, insert the new ones in their
place within their status group, and append one `Log` line.

**Insert; do not re-sort the table.** Re-sorting means re-emitting all 474
rows, which is the write-side twin of `cat`-ing the file — the same cost paid
again, and the occasion for a lost row. Each new row goes where its match puts
it, and the file stays sorted because it was never unsorted.

**Compose each new row with the tool, never by joining strings with `|`:**

```bash
python3 "$S/ledger.py" row '{"ID": "<board:id>", "Role": "<title>", "Company": "<employer>",
  "Location / mode": "…", "Posted": "…", "Match": "…", "Status": "todo", "Note": "…"}'
```

It escapes every cell — a title or an employer carrying a `|` would otherwise
be a column break, and a break before `Status` shifts the status (#200) — and
serves the row in the ledger's own column order. When you edit an existing
row's `Note` instead, pass the imported text through `ledger.py escape` first.

**Then check both invariants instead of asserting them:**

```bash
python3 "$S/ledger.py" stamp --expect "$LEDGER_STAMP"   # BEFORE writing
python3 "$S/ledger.py" verify --before <the count from step 0>   # after
```

**The stamp check runs before the write and the row count after**, because they
catch different things: one says somebody else got there first, the other says
your own merge lost something. **If the stamp moved, do not write** — re-read,
re-apply, and tell the user it happened.

It exits 5 if the ledger came back shorter, **and 6 if a row's cells no
longer line up with the header** — a shifted row is a lost row that still
counts, and its status is the one that cannot be trusted. `shared/pipeline-format.md`
opens with *read it first, write it last, and never lose a row*; this is the
last clause as a check.

**The `Pay` column: record only what the board published.** Some boards attach a
figure to the ad — jobup does — and when the adapter extracts one, put it in
`Pay` with its tier letter (`(A)` if it is the employer's own range, `(B)` if it
is the board's estimate). **Never derive a figure here:** estimating per ad
across a whole sweep is expensive and would fill the ledger with
low-confidence numbers wearing the same clothes as real ones. Leave `—`;
`cover-letter` fills it properly at step 3b when the user picks the ad.

If a module is enabled in `config.yml` (`modules.unemployment_declaration`),
read `shared/modules/<name>.md` and honour what it asks of the ledger — some
modules add a marker to the `Note` column that must never be stripped.

Then report: how many ads were scanned, how many are new, the top matches with
their scores, and **what was discarded and why**. The discards matter — they are
what the user does not have to look at again.

**Name the version that produced the run**, in the same block as the counts:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/bin/version-check.py" --print-version
```

One line — *job-scan v1.92.0* — and it makes every report above
self-diagnosing. A run on 2026-09-02 executed from plugin cache **1.52.0**
while the repository was at 1.85.1, reproduced a board failure fixed 53
releases earlier, and **nothing in the run said which code had produced it**.
A board failure observed on stale code is not evidence about the board. Issue
#78.

**Then the accounting, per `shared/never-fail-silently.md`.** Give the counts as
*n of m*, never as a bare total: searches run of searches planned, descriptions
read of ads shortlisted, boards swept of boards enabled. Close with the "not
done this run" block whenever anything was skipped, capped or scored
provisionally — a board skipped for a missing key, a search cut short by
throttling, ads scored from the card alone. **A run that ends with nothing new
still owes the user the zero and the reason for it.**

### Before offering dormancy, check the language of the query

**A board that returned zero may have been asked in the wrong language.**
Measured on Adzuna's Swiss index, 2026-09-02:

| `what=` | Matches |
| :-- | --: |
| `Entwickler` | **12 666** |
| `developer` | 3 162 |
| `informaticien` | 138 |
| **`développeur`** | **0** |

Same market, same board, same day. **This skill builds its search terms from
the user's own profile**, so a French-speaking user is served French terms —
and on a German-leaning Swiss index that returns nothing, with HTTP 200 and no
error.

**So a zero from a multilingual market is not evidence of an empty board until
the query has been asked in the market's own language.** Adapters now say this
themselves (`_zero.py`), and the run must not turn such a zero into a dormancy
offer without trying the other language first.

### Pass the user's own languages down; the adapters cannot read the config

**No adapter here reads `config.yml` for the profile, and none should.** The
skill holds the profile, so the skill passes it — `languages.working`, on the
boards that take a `--speaks` flag:

```bash
python3 skills/job-scan/scripts/adzuna.py search --country ch \
    --what "développeur" --speaks "French, English"
```

It changes nothing until a search returns zero. Then the sweep can say which
of the market's languages the person actually works in, what a measured term
returns in each — and **what the languages they do not work in return.**

**That last part is not a detail, it is the design.** A German search on a
Swiss board returns German ads, which mostly require German: handing 12 691 of
them to somebody who does not speak it replaces a misleading zero with a
misleading flood. So the sweep says *your French search returns 0; the same
index returns 12 691 in German, which you have not declared as a working
language* — **and the person decides.** Not hiding that market, not pouring it
out.

The terms are in `shared/search-language.md`, which records **measurements and
dates, never translations**: a guessed translation that also returns zero
manufactures a second zero, and two zeros read as a certainty.

**One exception, and it is not profile — #206.** `ats.py` reads
`boards.smartrecruiters.override_robots` from the workspace's `config.yml`
itself, for `api.smartrecruiters.com` only. *That key is a consent the user
gave once, after the cost was read out; it is the adapter's own key («&nbsp;the
adapter owns its config keys&nbsp;», §2), and a step of this skill was supposed
to carry it as `--override-robots` — no step did, and four configured employers
returned `0` each, a zero that reads as «&nbsp;not hiring&nbsp;».* **A consent
that has to be re-transmitted by prose is a consent that gets lost, so the code
that needs it reads it where it lives.** Nothing else in the file is read, a
test keeps it at one adapter, and the exit-7 message names the file it
consulted. The sweep passes nothing for it.

### And the limit, so nobody mistakes this for solved

**The trigger is a zero. A thin result misleads just as much, and nothing
fires.** `informaticien` returns **129 of the Swiss index's 81 516 ads** — 1%
of the market, and not zero. The same holds for a filter that silently drops
most of an index: on Adzuna's Swiss board `category=it-jobs` returns **1 150**
against **12 691** for one German keyword, because 70.7% of that index is
unclassified.

**Neither case will announce itself.** When a board comes back with a
suspiciously thin count on a market you know to be large, say so in the run
report rather than passing the number on.

**And the same caution applies to any fill rate quoted from one language.** On
50 German Adzuna ads a salary appeared on **0** and `contract_type` on **0**.
"This board is poor in salaries" may be an artefact of the language queried:
**a fill rate measured in one language is not the board's fill rate.**

### Tenants seen in this run that the config does not sweep

**An ad's apply URL often names an ATS the user already has enabled, under a
tenant they never configured.** The provider is in the host, the tenant one
path segment in — and until now nothing read either.

```bash
python3 "$S/tenant_offer.py" scan --probe --urls <one apply URL per line>
```

Offer only the rows whose `offer` is true — *"3 ads point at
`smartrecruiters:Evooq`, not configured; add it?"* — folded into the run's
closing report, **never written for them**. It is their file, and this is the
same constraint as the board offer in `cover-letter`.

**Why observation beats probing here, and it is the point of the feature:**
`shared/boards/smartrecruiters.md` records that **a wrong tenant answers 200
with zero ads**, indistinguishable from an employer that is not hiring. So a
tenant cannot be guessed and confirmed — **the only safe way to add one is to
have seen it on a real advert**, which is precisely what a sweep produces.

**Both ends of a redirect chain lie.** jobup publishes SICPA's URL as
`sicpa.contactrh.com`, a 302 with a zero-byte body; reading it as published
says *unknown provider*. And `boards.greenhouse.io/elastic` ends at
`jobs.elastic.co/`, a vanity domain that names no provider either. The script
identifies at every hop and takes the first that names one — and `--probe`
asks the host itself when none does, which is how a SuccessFactors tenant on an
employer's own domain (`jobs.sicpa.com`) is found at all. Issue #83.

### A board that swept fine and yielded nothing: offer dormancy, don't just say it

**When a board completed its sweep and produced no kept row, say so with the
counts — and then offer to park it.** *"randstad: 18 ads, 4 in range, 0 kept"*
is a fact the user cannot act on; the offer is what turns it into a decision.

The offer has three doors, and the middle one is the point of this whole
mechanism:

| Offer | When it is the right one |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Leave it on** | One empty run is thin evidence. A board swept for the first time, or one whose queries were narrow this run, has not been measured yet |
| **Make it dormant** | The zero looks structural *for now* — but the board is geographically or technically plausible, so a later look is worth one question a quarter. Write the four `dormant_*` keys, with the **counts** in `dormant_reason` |
| **Switch it off** | The board serves a different trade entirely, and no month will change that. `enabled: false`, no `dormant_*` keys, silent from then on |

**Put the counts in `dormant_reason`, never an adjective.** *"nothing
relevant"* tells the user nothing three months later; *"10 vacancies, all
apprenticeships"* lets them decide in one read — and it is what the re-check
compares against.

**Two boards with the same zero can deserve different doors, and usually do.**
On a real run on 2026-08-30: sozialinfo returned 687 ads with 1 in range —
social-sector work, a trade the candidate will still not be in next year.
umantis returned 10, all of them apprenticeships, from an employer **25 minutes
away** on an adapter that worked perfectly. Identical zeros; the second is
timing and the first is not. Reading them the same way is how the good bet gets
thrown out with the bad one.

**A board that failed is named in that block with its issue URL**, or with the
fact that no issue was filed and why — the user declined, `gh` was unavailable,
a duplicate was already open. *"jobup returned nothing"* on its own is the
silent failure this whole rule exists to refuse: the user cannot tell a broken
adapter from an empty market, and those call for opposite reactions.

## 6b — Once a month, ask what they have done since last time

**At the end of the run, after the accounting, before the handoff** — and only
when the schedule says so:

```bash
python3 "$S/achievements.py" due
```

`due: false` → **say nothing at all.** Not a mention, not a "not this time".

`due: true` → one open question, in the candidate's own vocabulary:

> **Depuis un mois : de nouvelles réalisations, formations, certifications,
> responsabilités ?**

**Never a technical one.** *"Have you pushed any new repositories?"* answers
itself for one trade and excludes every other — a cabinetmaker's three fitted
kitchens, a nurse's palliative-care qualification and a designer's rebranding
are invisible to every export this plugin reads, **and only the question makes
them exist.** `shared/new-achievements.md` holds the whole behaviour: where the
answer goes by trade, why `repos.md` is never the default, the approval rule
before anything is written, and the LinkedIn text that the candidate posts
themselves.

**"No" is a complete answer** — `achievements.py asked --outcome none`, and
nothing more. **"Stop asking" must work** — `--outcome paused`.

**And never scan the disk for work to claim.** Issue #42.

## 7 — Hand off to `cover-letter`

Propose the top `todo` rows in match order. When the user picks one, invoke the
`cover-letter` skill with the ad URL rebuilt from the `ID`; it re-scores the ad
in depth, gates on go/no-go, and writes the resulting status back into the
ledger.

**A row they pass over here stays `todo`; a row they refuse here is a `no-go`
in the candidate's words, never in yours.** The hand-off is not a gate with
motivated refusals, and it must not become one: if they say *"not that one"*,
nothing is deduced from the ad's weak points — the `Note` carries what they
wrote, or `no reason given`, in the form `cover-letter` §3b defines. Issue #208.

**Read `employers.md` before the row's `Note`, not after.** A decision about a
company does not live on an ad's row, and looking for it there finds it only by
luck:

```bash
python3 "$S/employers.py" lookup --name "<the employer>"
```

It returns every standing decision **with its lifting date beside it**. A
freeze declared on one row and lifted on another eighteen rows away discarded
two live ads on 2026-09-02 — the note that was read was real, and the fact that
cancelled it was elsewhere. **No file is not a clean bill**: say *"nothing
recorded about this employer"*, which is an absence of record and not an
absence of decisions. Issue #94, and `shared/workspace.md` holds the authority
rule.

**A `preferred` employer changes the cadence, not the ranking.** Do not move
its rows up the list — say it beside the score, where the user can weigh it:
*"55% — an employer you favour"*. A preference that quietly reorders is the
same defect as one that quietly adds points, and
`shared/scoring-rubric.md` refuses both.

**An `excluded` employer's rows are not proposed — and the run says how many it
withheld.** *"3 ads from Acme not proposed: employer excluded 2026-09-03."* A
filter with no counter is the silent cap this plugin's first rule forbids, and
this one would hide exactly the ad that changes somebody's mind.

**Then read each row's `Note` before proposing it — match order is not the
whole ranking.** The rows you are about to recommend include ones written weeks ago by
earlier runs, and a `todo` row can carry a verdict its status never received: a
blocker found when its description was read, a hold on that employer, an
application already open there.

**A `` `WA:<CC>` `` marker is neither of those, and it is never a reason to
skip a row.** It is a route note: propose the ad in its rightful place in the
ranking, and put the sentence on the same line as the score — *"74% — GB:
local employment excluded, B2B possibly open"*. The user decides.

A row whose note settles the matter does not belong in the list — skip it, and
offer to correct its status. A row whose note raises an **open question** belongs
in the list, with the question named next to the score, because that question is
what `cover-letter` must resolve before drafting.

**Never present a row on its score and its commute alone.** That is exactly how a
.NET/C# role whose own note read *"bloqueur dur"* was recommended as a top pick
on a real ledger on 2026-08-27 — by a run that had, hours earlier, written the
rule about reading notes.
