# Render a markdown document to a clean A4 PDF via pandoc + xelatex.
# xelatex is used for robust UTF-8 / French-accent handling.
# Usage: render.sh <input.md> <output.pdf> [letter]
#   Pass "letter" as the 3rd arg for the roomier cover-letter geometry.
#
# WHEN THE CHAIN IS MISSING, THIS FALLS BACK TO render-plain.py rather than
# stopping (issue #114). That fallback DOUBLES this path, it does not replace
# it: whenever pandoc and xelatex are here, they are what runs, with the
# project's own template and Noto Sans, and nothing below changes.
#
# The install advice below is still printed when the fallback fires — a PDF
# with no LaTeX is a way to send something today, not a reason to stop wanting
# the real chain.

# ---- PDF weight -----------------------------------------------------------
# Do NOT post-process with Ghostscript. `gs -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook` shrinks a
# letter from ~169 kB to ~22 kB, but it re-encodes the fonts and loses the
# ToUnicode mapping for ligatures. The page looks identical while the extracted
# text silently rots: "qualifications" -> "quali cations", "mobile-first" ->
# "mobile- rst". For an ATS-parsed CV that is fatal — and it is invisible until
# a parser, not a human, reads the file.
#
# If a PDF is heavy, the cause is almost always the signature image, not the
# text. A 1600 px signature costs ~200 kB for a 2.2 cm render; stored at 320 px
# it is still ~370 dpi at that size and takes a signed letter to about 45 kB
# with the text completely untouched. Keep the original scan under another name
# and resize the copy (`sips -Z 320 signature.png` on macOS, `magick ... -resize`
# elsewhere) if the rendered signature ever needs more detail.
