#         never inside the plugin, which a update would replace)

# The input is a photo or scan of a signature on a BLANK WHITE SHEET, flat and
# in good light. A photo of a signature on lined or coloured paper will key
# badly: the paper colour is what gets removed.

# Needs: pdftoppm + magick (poppler + imagemagick) and Pillow.
