# Board adapter — CVbankas (Lithuania): the front page is the listing, 181 pages sum to the stated 9 113, and the sitemap is never asked for

## The rules — two names we never send, and 9 113 advertisements behind them

robots.txt      read twice, certain: True, 2744 B, md5 2c4561cefc2b both times
                Cloudflare's managed block (ClaudeBot named there, `*` open) — then the operator's:
                `User-agent: * / Disallow: /issaugoti-skelbimai.html, /prisijungti-*, /siusti-skelbima-draugui, /kandidatuoti-neuzsiregistravus, /banner-job-ads/, /facebook-data-deletion…`

verdict()       sweep True, sweep_token claudebot
allowed()       True on `/`, `/?page=N`, `/<slug>/<n>-<id>` — and on `/sitemap.xml`, which the adapter still never reads (below)
crawl_delay     none — 1 s between pages is ours
```

*#233 kept this host under «a name we never send» — the verdict that closed
it was right in its sentence and wrong in its scope
(`un-nom-pour-nous-nest-pas-un-nom-quon-envoie`, 2026-09-05).*

## The transport — 200 on the board, a challenge on the sitemap alone

```

```

**`/sitemap.xml` is never asked for**: `gate()` exits 7 on it before the
rules are consulted. *A path that answers a challenge is not the route
(borne 2), and a 403 on a sitemap is not a closed board
(`un-403-sur-un-sitemap-nest-pas-un-board-ferme`) — the listing serves the
same client one minute earlier.*

## The listing — pages that sum to the stated count

| question | answer |
| :-- | --: |
| stated on every page | **9 113** — «Ieškokite darbo tarp 9 113 pasiūlymų» / «Rodoma 9 113 skelbimų» |
| page 1 | **142** cards, all VIP (`jobadlist_article_vip`) |
| pages 2 … 180 | **50** each (pages 2 and 3 read, disjoint) |
| page 181 | **21** |
| 142 + 179 × 50 + 21 | **9 113** — equal to the unit |
| the card | `id` (`job_ad_<id>`, the URL's tail), title, employer, salary (amount, `€/mėn.` or `€/val.`, net «į rankas» / gross by the block's class), city («Kaune», «Danijoje»), age («prieš 1 d.») |
| page 1 census (142) | salary on 141 (net 79, gross 62), monthly 131, hourly 10; city on 142; employer on 142 |

**The adapter reads the stated figure on each page and prints «n emitted,
site states N — equal / k short» after a full walk; `--pages` bounds the
walk, says «the walk stopped at page p», and does not compare.** *A bounded
count is a lower bound, never a check.*

**The full walk, 2026-09-12 12:40:29–12:59:59 UTC — 181 pages, 19 min 30 s
at 1 s between requests plus the fetch of ~0.5 MB a page:**

```
[cvbankas] 181 page(s) read of 181; **9 111 distinct advertisement id(s)**.
[cvbankas] 9 111 emitted, site states 9 113 — 2 short.
```

*Two short over twenty minutes on a live board: the stated figure is read
on page 1 at 12:40 and the last page at 12:59, and an advertisement that
expires or moves between pages during the walk is counted by the site and
not by the walk — the result, not a defect; the arithmetic on four pages
read within a minute of each other gave 9 113 exactly.* Census of the
9 111: VIP 142 (page 1 and nowhere else); a salary on 9 019 — gross 5 459,
net 3 560, monthly 8 551, hourly 445; a city on all 9 111 — Vilnius 3 759,
Kaunas 2 160, Klaipėda 706, Šiauliai 377.

## What an advertisement carries — microdata, and obfuscated digits

`itemtype JobPosting` with `title` (the `<h1>`), `datePosted` (a
`content=` date), `validThrough` (a `datetime=`, with the posting and
renewal dates in its `title`), `hiringOrganization/name`, `jobLocation` →
`PostalAddress` («Užsienis : Danija» for abroad, the city otherwise),
`description`, the work type («Visa darbo diena»), and sections — «Darbo
pobūdis», «Reikalavimai darbuotojui», «Ką siūlome», «Atlyginimas» in
Lithuanian, «ABOUT THE ROLE», «REQUIREMENTS», «Salary» on an English page:
**a page is Lithuanian or English per advertisement, and the sections are
emitted under the headings the page uses.**

**The salary digits on the page are interleaved with U+200C, the zero-width
non-joiner** — `2‌2‌0‌0‌-3‌0‌0‌0‌` (`&#8204;` between every digit) — an
anti-scraping obfuscation the listing does not apply; the adapter strips it,
says so on stderr, and net / gross comes from the block's class
(`salary_bl_net` / `salary_bl_gross`), not from the language of the label.
**No contacts are read**: the only `mailto:` on the pages read is the
board's own address, and the adapter emits none.

## What this card is, and is not

- **An adapter, shipped** — `list` for the paged enumeration with the
  stated count as the check, `ad` for one advertisement from its microdata.
  No key, no browser; 181 requests for the whole board — 19 min 30 s measured, the pages are half a megabyte each.
- **Not a verdict on the sitemap** — one path, one challenge, dated; the
  board is served, and the adapter goes around the path rather than through
  it.
- **No configuration.** A user with a URL from this host can hand it to
  `cover-letter`.
