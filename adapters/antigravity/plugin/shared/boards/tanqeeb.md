# Board adapter — Tanqeeb (per-country, Arabic-speaking markets)

<!-- verified: 2026-09-05 -->

<!-- hosts: per-country -->
<!-- script: none -->
<!-- countries: DZ EG PS SY YE -->
<!-- content: indeterminate · rules unreadable on 6 of the 7 hosts known, HTTP 202 with a 0-byte body; the seventh was never queried here · 2026-09-05 -->
<!-- witness: none — nothing was fetched beyond robots.txt, and nothing could be -->

**No adapter exists and none can be written until this changes.** The state is
**indeterminate**, not closed: nothing here says the operator refuses us.

## The measurement, dated

**Six hosts of the same operator**, each with the date it was measured and by
whom — because two independent readings of this same set both said *five* and
they were not the same five:

    tanqeeb.com              2026-09-05   this session      HTTP 202   0 bytes
    algerie.tanqeeb.com      2026-09-05   this session      HTTP 202   0 bytes
    syria.tanqeeb.com        2026-09-05   this session      HTTP 202   0 bytes
    egypt.tanqeeb.com        2026-09-04   issue #155 body   HTTP 202   0 bytes
    yemen.tanqeeb.com        2026-09-04   issue #155 body   HTTP 202   0 bytes
    palestine.tanqeeb.com    2026-09-04   issue #155 comment, 21:15   HTTP 202   0 bytes
    iraq.tanqeeb.com         2026-09-05   another session, relayed    NOT QUERIED HERE

`d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` is the md5 of the empty string, on all six.

**A seventh host exists and was never queried here.** `iraq.tanqeeb.com` was
found on 2026-09-05 by another session, while it was instructing Iraq, and it
reported the same `202` with an empty body. **This card holds no artefact for
it** — no provenance record, no body, no md5 — so its row says `NOT QUERIED
HERE` rather than repeating a result on someone else's word.

**The counter said `6 of 6` and was internally consistent.** *That is what made
it dangerous: `6 of 6` reads as "everything was looked at", and nothing in the
card contradicted it.* **The list was short, not the count wrong** — and a
short list with a matching total is invisible to every check that compares the
two.

**`countries:` is deliberately NOT extended to `IQ`.** *That line declares
recruitment jurisdictions established by measurement, and nothing about
`iraq.tanqeeb.com` is measured here.* **Declaring a country on a relayed
sighting would put an unmeasured country into every aggregate that groups by
this field.**

**The 2026-09-07 revision is editorial, not a re-measurement** — `verified:`
is left at 2026-09-05 on purpose, and no host was contacted for it.

**The apex is not a country and adds none**; `countries:` carries the five
country subdomains.

The guard's own words, which are the finding:

> *HTTP 202 with a 0-byte body — a 2xx that is not 200 is not the document, and
> an empty body states nothing. **This is not an absence**: a 404 would say there
> are no rules, and this says only that something answered.*

**This is a dated observation, not a property of the site.** Nothing in an empty
body distinguishes a deployment from an intermittence, and the same hosts may
answer differently tomorrow.

## It is the operator, not Algeria

`_robots.py` documents `algerie.tanqeeb.com` as the host that answers 202 with
zero bytes, and the shape of the note invites the reader to look for what is
particular about Algeria. **Nothing is.** Four country subdomains answer
identically, **and so does the bare apex `tanqeeb.com`** — which is not a country
at all, so a per-country explanation is ruled out at the operator level.

The Algerian host is the one that produced the fix in #125; it is not the one
that has the behaviour.

## Why the host list stops at six, and why that is not laziness

The issue asks for **every `tanqeeb` subdomain the repository can name**. It can
name one — `algerie.tanqeeb.com` — and this sheet adds the five measured beside
it, four of them from #155 and its comment, one measured here.

**The obvious way to extend the list is to read the apex and let the operator
name its own countries.** That is the method that closed a thirty-two-host
network on 2026-09-05, without composing a single hostname.

**It cannot be used here. The apex is itself indeterminate, and an indeterminate
is not probed** — that is the standing rule, and it binds hardest exactly when
the result would be useful. The alternative, composing `<country>.tanqeeb.com`
for countries the operator plausibly serves, is inventing hostnames.

**So the list is six, it is short for a reason that is written down, and it is
not a claim that the operator serves five markets.**

## What this blocks

`syria.tanqeeb.com` is the only known intermediary for the Syrian market. The
country is therefore neither *empty category* nor *access refused* but
**indeterminate**, and the same lock sits on Algeria, Yemen and Egypt.

**Writing "closed" here would be the error the state exists to prevent** —
`robots.txt` was never read, so no refusal was ever expressed. See
`shared/never-fail-silently.md` on the three states, and `shared/robots-policy.md`
for how `None` propagates.

## What would change this

- The hosts answering **200 with a body**, at which point the rules can be read
  and the ordinary guard applies.
- A source outside the operator naming further subdomains — a listing, a press
  page, a link from a site we may read. **Not a guess.**

Until then: **no adapter, no country page claiming a closed market, and no
figure.**
