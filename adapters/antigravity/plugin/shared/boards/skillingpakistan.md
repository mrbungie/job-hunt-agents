# Assessed, adapter deferred — Skilling Pakistan

<!-- verified: 2026-09-07 -->
<!-- hosts: skillingpakistan.gov.pk -->
<!-- countries: PK -->
<!-- script: none -->
<!-- content: measured · 0 advertisements — `/jobs` renders a table server-side whose only row reads "No jobs available" · 2026-09-07 -->
<!-- witness: none possible — a board that states its own emptiness leaves no count for a second source to confirm · 2026-09-07 -->

## It IS a job board, and it is empty

**`content:` was absent, which does not mean "measured at zero": it means
nobody had opened the body.** It has been opened, and the answer is a zero
that was *read* rather than inferred.

**This is the distinction `out-of-domain` would have destroyed.** *It is not a
site that turned out to serve something else — it is a jobs page, rendered
server-side, with a table whose columns are a vacancy's fields, and nothing in
it today.* **A board that states its own emptiness is a different fact from a
host that has no board, and the two would look identical in a column.**

**Zero is dated.** The page is server-rendered, so the emptiness is the
server's answer and not a script that failed to run — *which is what a 704 KB
page with no advertisement would otherwise suggest.* **Re-reading it costs one
request and no adapter is warranted until it is not empty.**

Pakistan's TVET portal (National Vocational and Technical Training
Commission). `robots.txt` closes nothing — `sweep: True`, no rule matched.
`www.skillingpakistan.gov.pk` does not resolve.

**`/jobs` exists, is 704 kB, and its table says `No jobs available`.**

## The board is empty, and it says so in its own words

That distinction matters. This is **not** a zero inferred from a parse that
found nothing — the server-rendered table contains the sentence. `_zero.py`
exists because *a search that matches nothing and a market that has nothing
look identical*; here the board removes the ambiguity itself.

Checked against every filter the form offers, including values drawn from the
site's **own** occupation vocabulary:

```
/jobs                              No jobs available
/jobs?jobType=1        (Govt)      No jobs available
/jobs?jobType=4        (Private)   No jobs available
/jobs?jobType=2        (Overseas)  No jobs available
/jobs?occupation=Security+Guard    No jobs available
/jobs?gender=Male                  No jobs available
```

The occupation dropdown is populated from real data — *Security Guard*, *AUTO
DENTER*, *Senior Civil Engineer* — so the database is not empty. **The
listing is.**

## The number on that page is not an advertisement count

The same `/jobs` page prints, above the empty table:

```
Total Male Jobs    299,334
Total Female Jobs    3,279
Total Jobs         302,613
```

**Those are labour-market statistics under an "Employment Trends" heading, and
they sit directly above a table with nothing in it.** Anyone quoting 302 613
as this board's advertisement count would be out by 302 613. It is the exact
shape `atlas`-facing work has been wrong on before: *a headline number that
reads as a total.*

## Why no adapter yet

**No row has ever been available to parse.** A parser written against the
five column headers alone — `Title`, `Province`, `Country`, `Gender`,
`Job Type` — would be a guess at the row shape, shipped unverified, and this
repository's cards end with *"Verified against the live site"* for a reason.

**The check to re-run** is one request: fetch `/jobs` and look for
`No jobs available`. When it stops appearing, the table is the whole listing
(server-rendered, no pagination links, no AJAX route in the page) and the
adapter is half an hour's work.

*`verified:` corrected 2026-09-08 from 2026-09-03 to 2026-09-07 (#188-adjacent guard): this card's `content:` carries a measurement of 2026-09-07 and the commit that wrote it exercised the host, so the card's age was understated. **The measurement was right and the header was behind** — `adapter-age.sh` was filing it older than it is.*
