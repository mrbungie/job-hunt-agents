# When this plugin overrides a robots.txt

**The default is to obey, and it is not close.** This file exists because
"obey" and "refuse" were being decided board by board, and one board — the
Austrian AMS — is now decided the other way. A rule applied once is a
preference. A rule written down is a policy, and it has to explain the cases it
already decided as well as the new one.

`robots.txt` is not law. It is the operator's stated wish, published in the one
place a machine will look. This plugin's users are individuals asking for a
fetch on their own behalf — the `Claude-User` class, not a training crawl — so
the wish is usually aimed at somebody else. **That is a reason to read the file
carefully, not a reason to skip it.**

Obeying costs coverage. Overriding costs the user's own access when an IP is
blocked, and costs the project its standing the first time someone reads the
code. **Default: obey.** What follows is the only route out.

## Before the four questions: did you read a file, and does the door open?

The four questions below assume two things — that you have read a
`robots.txt`, and that you know what the site does. **Both assumptions fail
routinely**, in ways that produce a confident wrong answer rather than an
error. That is why this section comes first: it decides whether the four
questions are being asked about anything real. Do not move it after them.

### A `robots.txt` verdict is not an access verdict

The file states the operator's wish. **It does not describe what the server
does, and it is wrong in both directions.** Two boards on one page, measured
2026-09-02:

| Site | `robots.txt` says | The pages do |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Glints** | 200, 587 bytes, permissive — nothing blocks a listing crawl | **403 to `curl` on every page**, 1.3 MB of firewall HTML — while a real Chrome loads everything |
| **Kemnaker** | 200, looks open | **825 KB of `text/html`** — an Angular skeleton. There were never any rules |

One permits and refuses; the other refuses nothing because it says nothing.
**Test two clients before concluding, and write the conclusion in the board's
own file** — "permissive file, 403 to a plain client, fine in a browser" is a
finding; "robots.txt is open" is not.

**And the two verdicts are fully independent, which one site settles on its
own.** `nea.gov.kh` **blocks access while expressing no intention at all**: its
file is the managed template, identical on three continents, so nobody there
decided anything — and the pages are shut regardless. **Access without
intention, and it is the fourth corner of the table.**

The day's count, so the asymmetry is a number and not an impression:

| | |
| :-- | --: |
| `403` to a plain client, **fine in a real browser** | **nine sites** |
| refused at *both* layers — the operator means it | **two** |
| a `200` with **no `robots.txt` at all** behind it | one, serving its home page on every path |
| a **`202` with an empty body** | one |

**Nine against two is why "curl got a 403" is never the finish.**

### Test the apex and the `www` separately — it bites in both directions

`www.findajob.dwp.gov.uk` leaves for a domain that `403`s while the apex
answers 200; and the mirror image, `jobs.co.id/robots.txt` is a clean 30-byte
rules file while `www.jobs.co.id/robots.txt` redirects and serves 171 888 bytes
of HTML. **One host is not the other host**, and `104.com.tw` serves two
different md5s across the pair.

**Three rebrands surfaced in one afternoon by reporting the answering host**,
2026-09-03: `my.indeed.com` → `secure.indeed.com`, `jobs.recruitee.com` →
**`careers.tellent.com`** (Recruitee is Tellent), and `talent-soft.com` →
**`www.cegid.com`** (Talentsoft is Cegid), whose 268 KB of HTML makes the file
`unreadable`. **A board that has been bought reaches us as a redirect long
before it reaches us as a rename**, and only the answering host shows it.

**And the host you name is not always the host that answers.** `_robots.py`
now reports both, and the first thing it corrected was one of this file's own
examples: the **126 KB of sign-in HTML** cited here as `my.indeed.com`'s reply
is served by **`secure.indeed.com`**, after a cross-host redirect. The guard
was right and the attribution was not — and nothing could show that while the
result carried only the name that had been typed. Issue #99.

**How often do the two forms really differ? Measured, because the answer
decides whether it is worth two requests a host.** Across **55 comparable
hosts** already known here, 2026-09-03:

| | |
| :-- | --: |
| raw md5 difference | **5 of 55** |
| **two real rules files that differ** | **2 of 55** |

**Three of the five were not two rules files at all** — `job-room.ch`'s apex
redirects to its home page, `job.id`'s `www` answers 59 KB of HTML, and
`digitalrecruiters.com` sends both forms to `www.cegid.com`. **Comparing bytes
without asking whether a rules file came back inflated the finding by more than
double**, which is this page's own `text/plain` guard skipped by the
measurement that was checking it.

**And the residue is not harmless.** `jobindex.dk` serves **47 bytes of
`User-agent: * / Disallow: /`** on the apex and **4 218 bytes of detailed
permissions** on the `www`. An adapter written against the `www` never sees the
refusal, and `_robots.py --siblings` says so in one line.

**So: a diagnostic run once when a board is written, not two requests on every
sweep.** Four per cent does not justify doubling every run; one blanket refusal
hidden behind a `www` justifies looking once.

**And a third host is not a variant of the first two.** `ss.ge` redirects to
`home.ss.ge`, whose jobs section redirects again to `jobs.ss.ge` — **three
hosts, three `robots.txt` files, three different sets of refusals**, measured
2026-09-03:

| Host | Size | Refuses |
| :-- | --: | :-- |
| `ss.ge` | 478 B | `/en/jobs`, `/ru/jobs`, and eight `/user/…` paths |
| `home.ss.ge` | 105 B | three `/…/user` paths — **and none of the job refusals** |
| `jobs.ss.ge` | 62 B | nothing: `Allow: /` |

**The host every request is redirected to has the more permissive file**, and
the one that governs the board says `Allow: /` while the board itself answers
`403` behind a challenge. **Which file applies depends on where the redirect
chain leaves you**, so read the file for the host you will actually fetch —
not for the name you typed. `shared/boards/ss-ge.md`.

*(Its apex file also opens with `sitemap: Disallow: /sitemap.xml` behind a BOM
— a `Sitemap:` directive whose value is a `Disallow:`. Read as either it is
nothing, which is one more reason to fetch the path rather than parse the
line.)*

**And the third mechanism in the pair is TLS, which fails before any status
code exists.** `trabajo.gob.ec` resolves and answers nothing a client will
accept — `curl: (60) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches
target host name` — while **`www.trabajo.gob.ec` serves the file normally**,
`200`, 176 bytes. Verified 2026-09-03.

**Which of the two names works is not predictable**, and that is the whole
point: `philjobnet.gov.ph` is this case running the other way — there the
**apex** is the service and `www` presents Azure's default certificate. Two
labour ministries, opposite answers, and a probe that tries one name and stops
writes off a live national service either way. **Try both, and record which one
you used**, because a certificate that does not cover the name is an outage of
identity, not a policy — see *A non-answer is not a refusal* below.

**And a certificate can be valid and still fail for you alone.**
`empleate.gob.es` — Spain's SEPE board — **does not send its intermediate
certificate**. `curl` succeeds with `200` because the system trust store
happens to hold that intermediate; `openssl s_client` reports *"unable to
verify the first certificate"*; **Python's `urllib` refuses outright**, and
`empleate.py` and `oposiciones.py` both fail today with
`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`.

**So the site is fine in a browser, fine under `curl`, and broken for the
adapter** — a failure that depends on **what the client trusts**, exactly as
the broken gzip framing on `www.trabajo.gob.ec` depends on what the client
asked for. **Test the fetch the adapter actually performs**: a `curl` that
works proves the server is up and nothing about whether the code can reach it.

*(Measured 2026-09-03, at the layer below both adapters — `curl` 200,
`openssl` verify code 21, `urllib` refused.)*

### A non-answer is not a refusal

**"Did not respond" and "refused" are different facts and only one of them is a
door.** Measured in one country: a board that timed out three times, one whose
TLS fails on the name, and one returning `530` from a dead origin. **None of
those is closed** — nobody refused anything; the request never arrived at
something able to answer.

A refusal is a **`403` with a body that came from the site**. A timeout, a TLS
name mismatch and an origin error are the network failing to deliver a
question, and recording them as refusals turns an outage into a policy.

**And the reverse of the same rule**: `shared/robots-policy.md` already refuses
to read an absent file as a refusal. This is that rule applied one layer down —
**absence of an answer is not an answer.**

### A `robots.txt` that is not `text/plain` is not a `robots.txt`

**And an absent header is not a declaration of HTML.** The guard was written as
*"not `text/plain`"* against a default of `""`, so a server that declares
nothing had its file rejected without being looked at: `hukoomi.gov.qa` serves
a valid **468-byte** `robots.txt` with **no `Content-Type` at all**, and the
plugin called it unreadable. **An absence of metadata is not negative
metadata** — the same asymmetry as *an absent `robots.txt` is not a refusal*,
one level further down. When the type is missing, **the first line decides and
the size corroborates**: a rules file opens on a directive and runs to a few
hundred bytes; the impostors open on `<` and run to 126 015. Issue #96.

One check, and it catches three separate traps already in this repository:

| Fetched | Status | `Content-Type` | Bytes | What it really was |
| :-- | --: | :-- | --: | :-- |
| `my.indeed.com/robots.txt` | 200 | `text/html` | **126 015** | Indeed's sign-in page — `my.` is *my profile*, not Malaysia (issue #64) |
| `kemnaker.go.id/robots.txt` | 200 | `text/html` | 825 204 | An Angular SPA skeleton |
| `mycareersfuture.gov.sg/sitemap-5.xml` | 200 | `text/html` | 7 923 | The site's own React shell, named `.xml` |

**The size is the second witness, and the gap is three orders of magnitude.**
Real files: **58 bytes** (`jobth.com`), **59** (Kalibrr), **87**
(MyCareersFuture), **275** (JOBBKK). The impostor: **126 015**. A `robots.txt`
of 126 KB does not exist.

The same test generalises: **a sitemap that is not XML is not a sitemap**, and
an index that declares six sub-files two of which are HTML shells will
overstate a corpus by a factor of three if you multiply instead of counting.

### Decide by layer: a browser can only change what happens above it

When only one client can be tested, or when a second test would tell you
nothing, **locate the failure relative to the browser**:

| A browser can change the result | A browser can change nothing |
| :-- | :-- |
| HTTP 403, client filtering, TLS fingerprinting | DNS record absent |
| A CDN interstitial | TCP silent on 443 **and** 80 |
| A stub carrying a JavaScript redirect | An honest 404 |
| A login wall on the paths you need | The host answering as a different service |

Two symmetrical mistakes follow, and both have been made here: **spending a
browser on a failure that sits below it**, and **concluding "closed" from a
single client that sits above it**.

**TLS is a third category, and it is the one that produced wrong verdicts.**
An expired or mismatched certificate stops every client that checks — a
browser included — so it looks like the right-hand column. It is not: **the
service underneath is often perfectly alive, and only its proof of identity
has lapsed.** Three boards were written off as unreachable on that basis and
all three were live: `careerbuilder.vn` answers and redirects to CareerViet,
`jobs.id` to Karir.com, `bestjobs.ph` to BestJobs Network. **A plain HTTP
request separates "expired identity" from "vanished service"** — make it
before writing the board off.

**What the rule costs when it is missing.** `doe.go.th`, Thailand's Department
of Employment, probed with `curl`: **200, 1 674 bytes, no title, no text** —
read as *"there is no service here"*, and a country's public employment service
written off. The body is a **stub carrying a JavaScript redirect**, which is
exactly what a plain client cannot follow. **Nobody caught it because the
number was small and an empty body reads like an absent service.**

And the rule pays in the other direction too: of four unreachable public
services in one survey, **three failed below the layer** — silent TCP, absent
DNS — so an instruction to *"re-test everything in a browser"* would have
wasted three probes out of four. **Exactly one failed above it, and that one
was the wrong verdict.**

### A site permission is never a manual task

**"Authorise these three domains in the browser extension" was handed to a user
as a blocking task. The permission was never missing** — the extension had been
set to all sites throughout. The cost was three entries published with no
verdict, and one blocking task that did not exist.

**If a browser probe fails, the cause is something else, and that cause is what
to name.** Never *"the user must grant access"*.

### A passive interstitial is re-read; a challenge that asks for a click is a stop

`grabjobs.co` answered `403` even on `robots.txt`, **and cleared by itself
within seconds** between two reads, with no interaction. **That is a wait, not
a wall** — re-read before concluding.

**A challenge that requires a click is the opposite**, and it is not something
to work around: it is the answer, and it is recorded as such.

> **Assuming an obstacle is a way of not looking.**

### The failure with no status code, which is on no axis at all

`HTTP/2 stream not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR` on a cold request; a read
timeout after a burst. Measured on the StepStone platform, both shapes, on
hosts that answer 200 to the very next request.

This is **not a response to interpret** — it is the absence of one, so it sits
neither above nor below the browser. What makes it worth naming is its
consequence: **it is the only category where a client that retries loops for
ever**, because there is no status to read and nothing to decide on. Its
remedy is the transport and the pace — HTTP/1.1, a warmed host, one slow retry
and then a declared truncation — not another client.

### Proving a family: the md5 answers one question, the diff answers another

Multi-country boards are usually one platform wearing national domains, and
`robots.txt` is the cheapest test of that. **But the test has two forms, and
using the wrong one gives the wrong answer.**

> **The md5 answers "is this the same file". The diff answers "is this the
> same platform". When the file contains the hostname — and every `Sitemap:`
> line does — the md5 always diverges and tells you nothing.**

Both cases, measured 2026-09-02:

- **Computrabajo declares no sitemap**, so the md5 is decisive:
  `cfcbd02061ac…`, 874 bytes, **byte-identical across eighteen Latin American
  domains with no exception**. One hash, one answer, eighteen countries.
- **The Jobint group — Bumeran, Konzerta, Laborum — gives five different
  md5s and five different sizes**, which refutes the hypothesis at first
  glance. Compare the bodies **without the `Sitemap:` lines** and four of the
  five brands are identical to the bit, with `bumeran.com.pe` diverging by
  **exactly one line**: a template, one exception, one country — the SEEK
  shape.

**And the strongest evidence there was not in any hash.** Laborum and Konzerta
declare sitemaps named **`sitemap_avisos_bum.xml`** — the `_bum` of Bumeran
surviving under the other brands' names. A filename outlived the rebrand, and
no checksum would have found it.

So: **hash when the file carries nothing host-specific, diff when it does, and
read the filenames either way.**

**And before any of that, establish that what you hashed is the file.** Re-run
on 2026-09-03, this time with a bare `curl`:

```
ec.computrabajo.com   403   118 bytes   bad2e8579dcdb79399aac2064216a37d
co.computrabajo.com   403   118 bytes   bad2e8579dcdb79399aac2064216a37d
pe.computrabajo.com   403   118 bytes   bad2e8579dcdb79399aac2064216a37d
```

**Three hosts, one hash, and the right conclusion for the wrong reason.** Those
118 bytes are a refusal page; the file is 874 bytes and appears only for a
request carrying an ordinary `User-Agent` and `Accept-Language` — at which
point all four hosts, `.com.mx` included, return `cfcbd02061ac…` as recorded
above. **A hash comparison agrees perfectly when nothing answered**, which is
`shared/plausible-and-false.md`'s *blind agreement* in its cheapest form: the
check shares its object's failure mode, because the failure is identical
everywhere. **Assert the family on responses you have confirmed are the file —
status `200`, `text/plain`, and a size that is not the size of an error
page.**

### Five words for the verdict, used identically in every board file

| Word | Means |
| :-- | :-- |
| **open** | The door answers, the file permits, the content is there |
| **refused** | The operator says no, in `robots.txt` or in the terms |
| **inaccessible** | The infrastructure stops you: DNS, TCP, a WAF, a login wall |
| **not sanctioned** | It answers and nothing forbids it, but nobody built it as an interface — `shared/boards/README.md` on Norway |
| **substituted** | **A complete HTTP 200 answering a question nobody asked** |

The last one is new and it earns its place. Kalibrr returns 818 unrelated ads
for a country it does not serve and for a nonsense keyword, flagging it in one
boolean; StepStone pads a thin result with `semantic` and `regional` ads that
are indistinguishable in the markup. Neither is *open*, neither is *refused*,
and calling either an error loses what actually happened.

## How a file splits into groups — and why `grep` gives a wrong, convincing answer

**The four questions below are answered "in the board's own file". This is how
to read that file**, because the splitting is not what it looks like.

`secretcv.com`, in full order: `User-agent: *` / `Allow: /`, then the same for
`GPTBot`, then the same for `OAI-SearchBot`, **then nineteen `Disallow:` lines
after a blank line.**

Read by eye, the site is closed to everyone. **Read by the standard, a blank
line does not end a group** — so those nineteen lines belong to the last
declared agent. Resolved with `urllib.robotparser` rather than asserted:

| agent | `/is-ilanlari/ara` |
| :-- | :-- |
| `OAI-SearchBot` | **refused** |
| `*`, `GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot` | allowed |

**The only agent that file restricts is OpenAI's**, which is almost certainly an
authoring accident.

**Here the eyeball reading errs on the cautious side.** Inverted — an `Allow: /`
written under one named agent and read as global — **it produces a false
permission**, and that is the direction that costs this project its standing.

### The three rules

1. **Group boundaries are `User-agent` lines, not blank lines.** A rule after a
   blank line still belongs to the group above it.
2. **Consecutive `User-agent` lines share one rule set.**
3. **Resolve with a parser, then quote the result.** `urllib.robotparser` is in
   the standard library and takes three lines. **`grep` on `Disallow` is wrong
   and convincing on any file with more than one group** — and multi-group
   files are the norm: 65 groups on `tr.indeed.com`, 20 on `hh.ru`, 17 on
   `youthall.com`.

### Repeated groups for the same agent are merged, not discarded

`yes123.com.tw` serves **eight consecutive `User-agent: *` groups**, one
directive each; `jobscentral.sg` served nine. **The tempting reading is that a
conforming client obeys the first and the other seven apply to nobody. That is
wrong**, and it is wrong in the permissive direction.

Measured with the standard-library parser on eight groups of one `Disallow`
each — and this is what RFC 9309 prescribes, records bearing the same product
token being combined:

```
/p1 refused   /p4 refused   /p8 refused   /elsewhere allowed
```

**All eight bind.** A reader who applied the first group only would have
concluded that seven paths were open.

### And a group with no directive forbids nothing

`cake.me` serves `User-agent: *` **with nothing under it**. Verified: every
path is allowed. **An orphan group is not a refusal** — nothing is written, so
nothing is forbidden, and *"it has a `User-agent: *`"* is not a finding.

*(All three verdicts on this page were computed with `urllib.robotparser`, not
read off the file — which is rule 3 applied to this page itself.)*

## The four questions

Answer all four **in the board's own file**, in writing, before any code. One
"no" and the answer is: do not build it.

**1. Is the refusal aimed at us?** Read which class the file is talking about —
the answer stopped being binary a long time ago. `leboncoin` allows
`Claude-User` and closes `/recherche`: it permits the fetch and refuses the
sweep, which is precisely us. `softy` bans every AI agent outright.
`tecnoempleo` names six Anthropic agents. **AMS names nobody** — it names
`LinkedInBot` to *allow* it, and closes the rest by omission.

**2. Is there a sanctioned door?** An API, a feed, a sitemap, an open-data set.
If one exists the debate is moot, and this has happened more often than not:
France Travail, ITJobs, Reed and Adzuna all publish one. **Establish its
absence, and record how you established it** — a 404 on a guessed API path is
not evidence.

**3. Is the refusal even-handed?** A site that closes the door to everyone has
made a policy, and it is entitled to it. **A public body that opens the door to
one commercial party and closes it to all others has not made a policy — it has
picked a winner.** Those are different acts, and only the second is a reason to
weigh an override at all. Note what this excludes: being big, being useful, or
being inconvenient to us are not reasons.

**4. Would the override be visible?** `shared/never-fail-silently.md` outranks
this file. An override the user cannot see in the run's own output is not
allowed, however good the argument for it.

## Question 2 is binding when the door is free — the rule that was missing

Decided by the owner on 2026-09-04, on #100. Quoted rather than paraphrased:

> *"Lorsque la porte nous est explicitement fermée et qu'un accès via API
> gratuite est disponible, utiliser la voie API. Pour l'adaptateur concerné un
> onboarding non technique à destination de l'utilisateur doit l'aider à
> configurer son app_id ainsi que sa clef"*

**This is not new doctrine. It is the rule that was missing from three
identical precedents**, each decided on its own and none of them written down
as a rule:

| precedent | what was decided | what was missing |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Question 2** itself, above | *"If one exists the debate is moot"* | *moot* was left to the reader — it never said **take the door** |
| **InfoJobs (ES)** | *"Obey. The API is the only route"* | decided for one board, on its own row |
| **SmartRecruiters** | added by the owner on 2026-09-03, by this same procedure | the ground was restated each time instead of cited |

**Three separate decisions were a preference. Written once, it is a rule.**

### Two conditions, and both must hold

1. **The door is explicitly closed to us** — the host published a refusal that
   covers this project. Not an absence, not a failure to reach it.
2. **A free API exists, sanctioned and self-service** — the operator publishes
   it, and a user can obtain access themselves without negotiating.

**The rule says nothing the moment either condition is missing.** In
particular it does **not** authorise:

- **a paid API**, anywhere, for any board;
- **reading without the key** — no key, no route, and the adapter says so
  rather than falling back to the pages;
- **settling one host's `robots.txt` with another host's API.** A refusal on a
  pages host is not answered by an API host's permission; they are different
  hosts and each speaks only for itself.

### It does not merge with the `unrecognised` decision

The two arrived within hours of each other and they cover different rows.
**A host that refuses and opens a door beside it is not a host that says
nothing.**

| host | what it did | which rule |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `api.francetravail.io` | `User-agent: * / Disallow: /` | **this one** — an explicit refusal |
| `api.adzuna.com` | `User-agent: * / Disallow: /`, 26 bytes | **this one** |
| `rest.arbeitsagentur.de` | answers 403 | **this one** |
| `api.apprentissage.beta.gouv.fr` | answered, expressed no rule | **`unrecognised`** — see *a body that says nothing does not say no* |

### The keyed API hosts do not consult the guard, and that is a rule

Settled by the owner on 2026-09-04, on #100:

> *"Si une API est disponible, on en conclut que l'entrée, si elle est
> bloquée, l'est techniquement — jeton, quota. Le check n'est pas de notre
> ressort."*

**So four adapters do not call `_robots`** — `adzuna`, `arbeitsagentur`,
`francetravail`, `labonnealternance` — and it is no longer an accident of the
code that each card happened to explain. **What stops you on an API host is
read in its answer: a 401, a 429, a quota.** Those hosts publish
`Disallow: /` to everyone, so consulting the guard would stop a route the
owner has decided to take.

**Nothing inherits this by omission.** The exemption covers a keyed API whose
door is explicitly closed and which the operator offers free and self-service.
An adapter that simply stops importing the guard has not acquired it, and a
case asserts the set is still exactly those four.

**And the exemption is from the verdict, not from the identity.** This half
has already broken once: on the day it was written, **two of the four were
sending no declared agent at all** — one carried its own string naming no
token, the other sent none and urllib announced `Python-urllib/3.x`. The audit
that had closed #120 counted what obeys and not what escapes. **An API route
is still a route that introduces itself**, and two of the four are now
exercised on the wire rather than only scanned.

### The onboarding is part of the rule, not a nicety

**Since this decision the key is no longer a convenience: it decides whether
the board lights at all.** A user who cannot obtain one has no route to that
board, because the pages route is closed and this rule sends them to the API.

Three adapters need a credential the user must obtain: **Adzuna, France
Travail, La Bonne Alternance.** `arbeitsagentur.py` does **not** — its
`jobboerse-jobsuche` key is published in the specification and hard-coded, so
it falls under the access half of this rule and outside the onboarding half.

**And the onboarding must not assume a terminal.** `README.md` promises *"in
an app… nothing else to install"*, while `setup.md` documents this step in
`printf`, `chmod 600` and `set -a`. Tracked as #131.

## The five cases, decided by the same rule

| Board | Aimed at us? | Sanctioned door? | Even-handed? | Verdict |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Softy** | Yes — every AI agent, Anthropic twice | No | Yes — same rule for all | **Obey.** Browser adapter, by choice not constraint |
| **Tecnoempleo** | Yes — six Anthropic agents named | No | Yes | **Obey.** No adapter, and there will not be one. Its ads still reach us through Empléate — see *When a refused board's ads reach us through an open one* |
| **InfoJobs (ES)** | Yes — `ClaudeBot`, `Claude-SearchBot` **and `Claude-User`** | Yes — `developer.infojobs.net`, key required | Yes — every AI vendor, same treatment | **Obey.** The API is the only route |
| **Leboncoin** | Yes — the sweep, not the fetch | No | Yes | **Obey.** Ad-by-ad via `cover-letter <URL>` already works |

## AMS — the reasoning, in full

`jobs.ams.at/robots.txt`, read 2026-08-31, is four rules:

```
user-agent: LinkedInBot
Allow: /public/emps/
Disallow:

user-agent: *
Allow: /public/emps/$
Disallow: /public/emps/
```

`LinkedInBot` gets the employer pages entire. Everyone else gets the index page
at that exact path — the `$` anchor — and nothing beneath it.

**Question 3 is why this one is decided differently.** The AMS is Austria's
federal public employment service, funded publicly and charged with placing
people in work. It has granted machine access to one privately held American
platform and refused it to every other actor — free, paid, closed or
open-source alike. That is not an operator protecting its infrastructure; it is
a public body allocating access to a public register.

**Question 2 was checked and came back empty**, and the check is the weak part
of this file: the `data.gv.at` CKAN endpoints tried returned `404` and `301`,
and the eJob-Room is an Angular application whose backend is inside a bundled
`main.js`. **No open-data route was found; none was proven absent.** If someone
finds one, it supersedes this section and the override goes away.

**What the argument does not extend to.** It is about *this* asymmetry, at a
*public* body. It says nothing about StepStone, willhaben or Monster, which
refuse everyone evenly and are entitled to. It does not travel by analogy to a
private board that happens to be large.

## If the answer is override: how

**Never a default.** The board's config takes an explicit key, absent means
off, and no setup flow turns it on for the user:

```yaml
boards:
  ams:
    enabled: true
    override_robots: true   # required; absent or false → the board is skipped
  smartrecruiters:
    enabled: true
    override_robots: true   # same key, same rule, decided 2026-09-03 (#121)
  hiringcafe:
    enabled: true
    override_robots: true   # same key — NOT the same rule: owner's decision 2026-09-11 (#198)
```

**~~There are three, and the third does not follow from the four questions.~~
— struck on 2026-09-13.** *The owner, verbatim to the pilot the same day at
18:2x UTC, asked whether Työmarkkinatori (#371) could have an override:
«&nbsp;oui, l'utilisateur doit pouvoir émettre une dérogation en son âme et
conscience&nbsp;».* **The mechanism is general, the three are its history.**
`boards.<board>.override_robots: true` is available on every board whose
rules refuse a route in writing, and it is the USER who sets it, in their
own name and conscience: never a default, never set by `job-setup` on their
behalf, always with the banner below, which says what is crossed before
what it costs. Since #403 the guard reads it for every adapter —
`_robots.allowed()` flips a written «no», and only a «no», when the key is
set for the running board (`board_key()`, the adapter's file name), names
the rule it crossed (`kind: override`) and prints the banner once per host
and run whatever the adapter prints; without the key the refusal stands
and the result names the key as available. **What follows is the record
of the three that came first** — each decided by the owner, each read by
its own adapter at the time — and it stays as history, not as a closed
list. *The third of them did not follow from the four questions:*
`hiringcafe.com/robots.txt` refuses `/*?searchState=*` to `User-agent: *` —
even-handed, aimed at nobody, no sanctioned door; by this file's own rule
that is *obey*, and it was obeyed from 2026-09-03 (#123) with collection
suspended beside it. **On 2026-09-11 the repository's owner decided
otherwise, verbatim: «&nbsp;Je confirme la dérogation hiringcafe, assigne
#198&nbsp;»** — after being shown that the refusal is written, that the pilot's local
doctrine named SmartRecruiters as the one exception, and that the cost is the
candidate's address. **Unconditional, and it lifts both refusals at once**:
the rule and the suspension, because a key that lifted one would look like it
acts and act on half. The record says this is a decision and not a reading;
the procedure below — the key, the onboarding, the banner, one request at a
time — applies to it unchanged. *~~A fourth override goes to the owner.~~
Since 2026-09-13 (#403) a fourth, and every one after, goes to the user who
sets the key: the owner decided the mechanism once, for all.*

**There were two before that, and there were nearly none.** SmartRecruiters was added on
2026-09-03 by the repository's owner, on the same ground and by this same
procedure. `api.smartrecruiters.com` publishes 72 bytes — `User-agent:
LinkedInBot / Allow: /v1/companies/`, then `User-agent: * / Disallow: /` —
**which is the AMS shape exactly**: a platform opened to one privately held
actor and closed to everyone else.

**The first reading offered for it was wrong, and the correction is part of
the record.** It cited an `llms.txt` said to address AI agents by name; that
file sits on `www.` and `developers.`, is generated by an SEO plugin on one of
them, and indexes marketing and documentation pages. **The most specific
declaration for the API host is the API host's own file, and it refuses.**
`shared/boards/smartrecruiters.md` carries the retraction.

**And the READING does not generalise — the KEY does.** Greenhouse, Workable
and both Lever hosts publish files of the same kind that permit, and are read
with none of this; a board that permits needs no key, and the guard flips
nothing that is not a written «no». *The sentence used to say the override
does not generalise; since 2026-09-13 the key is general and the judgement
stays the user's.*

**Skipped, not silently obeyed.** `enabled: true` without `override_robots`
must report the skip and say why, per `never-fail-silently.md`.

**The user is told before they are asked.** `shared/setup.md` **section 5d**
raises AMS during onboarding whenever the user's geography reaches Austria: it
quotes the four rules, states the ground the decision rests on, says that the
address that gets blocked is *theirs*, and says **which overrides exist** —
three decided by the owner (`setup.md` 5d, 5f, 5g) and, since 2026-09-13,
**the same key on any board whose card declares a written refusal**
(`setup.md` 5h): the flow tells the user what the rules refuse, that the key
exists, and that they set it in their own name — and does not recommend it. **A sentence that said "the only one"
was left standing while a second was added would be worse than no sentence**:
a user who is told the plugin overrides once, and finds it overrides twice,
has been told something false about it. It offers three answers — enable, leave off, decide later — with
**no default and nothing pre-ticked**, and a refusal is a hard off that is never
raised again. Until an adapter exists the step configures nothing and says so:
the stance is recorded under `pending_decisions.ams`, outside `boards:`, because
a board switched on with no adapter behind it reads as a bug.

**The run says it out loud**, every time, in the output the user reads —
**and it says what is crossed before what it costs** (#192, 2026-09-08):

> `ams: ROBOTS REFUSAL CROSSED — jobs.ams.at disallows /public/emps/ to every
> agent but LinkedInBot, and this run is reading it anyway because you enabled
> the override. What it costs you: the address that gets blocked is yours, not
> this project's. To stop: remove the override from config.yml. See
> shared/robots-policy.md`

**The order is the point, and it is not cosmetic.** *A banner that opens on the
consequence — «&nbsp;you might get blocked&nbsp;» — asks the reader to accept a
risk they run. A banner that opens on the refusal asks them to accept an act
they perform.* **Consenting to a risk is not consenting to an act**, and the
first wording of the SmartRecruiters banner made exactly that substitution.

*Note that AMS and SmartRecruiters do not refuse the same way — AMS scopes a
path and names an exception, SmartRecruiters writes `User-agent: * /
Disallow: /` to everybody. **Each banner states its own host's refusal; the
order is shared, the words are not.***

**Pace as if you were welcome.** One request at a time, a real delay between
them, no parallelism. An override is not a licence to be expensive.

**Stop on the first block.** A `403`, a captcha or a rate limit is the operator
answering the question directly. Report it and stop — do not rotate, do not
retry with another agent string, do not go to the browser to get around it.
`shared/boards/cadremploi.md` uses a browser because a script is *blocked*;
nothing of the kind applies to a site that has told you no.


## A refusal body shared between unrelated hosts is a vendor default

**The md5 of a refusal sorts before a browser does.** Since 2026-09-07 a
refused fetch leaves a record — status, bytes, the identity that was refused,
and the md5 of what came back — without keeping the body. That record made a
comparison possible that was not, and it answered on the first two hosts tried:

```
jobstore    403  25 bytes  9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf
hays        403  25 bytes  9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf
kariera.mk  403  25 bytes  9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf   <- 2026-09-07, root AND sitemap
sptojobslink 403 25 bytes  9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf   <- 2026-09-07, root, /sitemap.xml AND
                                                                the wp-sitemap.xml its rules declare
tala-com.com 403 25 bytes  9ccabba20b9f4ec7d18bd6644579e5bf   <- 2026-09-07, root, read twice
```

**Five unrelated hosts, five countries, five operators, the same refusal to
the byte** — `Your request was blocked.`

> **2026-09-08: `api.jobs.af` joins the family, and it is not a board.** *It is
> the JSON API behind `jobs.af`* — 403, 25 bytes, the same md5, read twice with
> the same digest. **A refusal body shared between a job board's front door and
> a bare API endpoint cannot be the operator's message about crawling**, which
> is the strongest form this argument has taken so far. The third and fourth were added the same day, both
with the two-fetch control already applied. **The fourth also corrected a
claim that had been repeated rather than measured**: a country page recorded
it as serving this body under HTTP *200*, which would have made it the one
member of the family a status check cannot see. It answers 403, like the other
three: the body is stable across two reads, so the
comparison is not being made against something that carries a per-request
element. That is a shared piece of infrastructure answering, not two editors
deciding — the same reasoning as *a Cloudflare refusal is not the editor's*,
moved from the rules file to the transport, and **measurable for the first
time** because the body's fingerprint is now recorded even though the body is
not.

**What it changes in practice.** The question *does this 403 refuse a client or
refuse everyone* is answered by opening a browser, which costs a session and a
page load. **The fingerprint triages first, for nothing:**

- a host whose refusal body is shared with unrelated hosts is answering with a
  vendor default — the browser is worth trying;
- a host whose refusal body is **its own** has decided something, and that is
  where the browser question is worth paying for and where the answer matters.

*It does not replace the check. It says which hosts are worth checking.*

### The fifth member settles a case this repository had left open

**`www.tala-com.com` is the host that made this question concrete.** It names
`ClaudeBot` and forbids it nothing, and answers 403 to our declared identity
on every path — *rules open, infrastructure closed, in a country of a hundred
million people whose rank-1 board refuses.* Until now the nature of that 403
was unknown, and «the operator decided something» was as available a reading
as «a vendor answered».

**It is the vendor.** `Your request was blocked.`, 25 bytes, the same md5 as
four unrelated hosts in four other countries, stable across two reads taken
before any comparison.

*So the browser question on this host is worth its cost, and it is worth it on
the fingerprint rather than on the hope*: nobody wrote that page about us. It
remains a **candidate** — driving the browser is a separate decision, and the
bound against defeating an anti-robot control has not been tested here,
because a static 403 is not a challenge.

### Fetch the same URL **twice** before comparing two md5s across hosts

**Some refusal bodies carry a per-request element, so their md5 moves while
their size does not.** Measured 2026-09-07: six refusals of about 5.5 KB
returned a *different* md5 on every request at constant byte count — the
`cf-ray` identifier was inside the body. Any cross-host comparison over those
six is void, and it is void in the direction that looks like a finding: every
host appears to have written its own refusal, so every host looks worth a
browser.

**The same instrument is right on one family and wrong on the other, and
nothing in the numbers says which.** The 25-byte body above is stable across
requests and across hosts; the 5.5 KB one is stable across neither. Both are
vendor defaults. Only a second fetch of the *same* URL separates them:

```
same URL, twice  ->  md5 identical    the fingerprint means something
same URL, twice  ->  md5 differs      the body is per-request; compare sizes
                                      and structure, never the digest
```

*A digest that changes between two fetches of one URL cannot establish that two
hosts differ. It cannot establish anything.*

**This rule is not specific to `cf-ray`.** A timestamp, a request id, a nonce in
an inline script, or a rotating asset hash all produce it. The check costs one
extra request and it is the only thing that tells you whether the next hundred
comparisons mean anything.

## Three shapes of refusal, and only one of them a browser would open

**Measured on `shared/` alone on 2026-09-07, without a single request.** *Two
sessions arrived at "nine" and at "two" the same evening and neither was wrong:
they were counting different shapes, and a third shape neither had isolated.*

```
(1) the RULES permit, the CONTENT answers 403, bare 25-byte body
    -> the only shape a browser decision would open
(2) the ROBOTS.TXT ITSELF answers 403          ->  host-closed UNTIL 2026-09-13;
    an ABSENCE of rules since #283 (owner) — as a 401 was since #201 — and
    the shape dissolves into (1): the transport is measured next, root and
    a listing, and it is THAT answer that sorts the host (static 403 → the
    browser candidate of #222, a challenge → bound 2, a 200 → an adapter)
(3) a CHALLENGE page, md5 different on every request
    -> the owner's second bound: never ask anyone to defeat an antirobot
       control. Excluded from any count of what could be opened.
```

**Shape (2) is the one that gets mistaken for a host to be opened.** *It is
worth settling — it is the owner's bound 0, whether a 403 is aimed at a client
or at everyone — but a rules file read by hand does not add a readable board.*

### What this repository ATTESTS, shape by shape

      www.bayt.com belongs here (2026-09-08) — but the six of the 5.5 KB
      family are NOWHERE NAMED in this file, so whether it is one of them
      or a seventh cannot be said. **A member cannot be added to a set
      whose members are not listed.**
```

**`www.bayt.com` was the declared first candidate and the measurement removed
it.** Its 5 507-byte body is titled `Attention Required! | Cloudflare` and
contains `captcha`; **its two reads differ**, diverging at byte 3 268. That is
an antirobot control, and bound 2 forbids defeating one. *It belonged to shape
(3) all along; nothing but a fetch could say so.* **Its size — 5 507 bytes,
moving md5 — is exactly the 5.5 KB family measured on 2026-09-07, so it may
well have been one of the six already counted.** *That family was recorded as
a cardinal and never as members, which is precisely what makes the question
unanswerable now.*

**A card that CITES the fingerprint is not a card that suffers it.** Sweeping
`shared/boards/` for `9ccabba2…` returns two cards, and `myjobsfiji.md` is one
of them — **for `sptojobslink.com`, a neighbouring host it measured**, not for
itself. `myjobsfiji.com` answers **HTTP 200 with 307 925 bytes** at
2026-09-08 04:47:36Z and its adapter reads 190 advertisements, exactly as its
own `content:` line always said. *Read as its own status, that block would
have manufactured a member that changed state and a contradiction with the
card — neither of which happened.* **The instrument that enumerates this
population reads `hosts:`, never a body quoted in prose.**

*Command: the twelve roots fetched twice each, `bin/fetch-body.py
--allow-refusal`, 2026-09-08 04:45–04:47 UTC; provenance beside each body.*

### Bound 0 is SETTLED on one member, and it inverts the verdict

**The owner's bound 0 asks whether a 403 is aimed at a client or at everyone.**
For this family it is now measured, once:

```
kariera.mk   our declared HTTP client, twice, 04:45Z    403, 25 bytes
kariera.mk   a real browser,  between 04:48 and 04:54Z   the full board
             (bounded by the 04:47:36Z fetch before it and the 04:53:59Z
              clock after it — the visit itself was not timestamped)
```

**The browser was served roughly thirty live advertisements** — employer, city
and expiry date each — plus the site's news column. **No captcha, no challenge,
no interstitial.** *The 403 is aimed at the client, not at everyone: the vendor
default is answering a client it does not recognise, and the operator's pages
are open.*

**This is measured on `kariera.mk` alone.** The other ten serve a body
identical to the byte, which makes the same result *expected* — expected is not
measured, and each is visited before it is declared.

### Visiting the eleven — what the fingerprint could not say

**A refusal fingerprint says who answered, never what the host serves.**
Visited 2026-09-08 **between 04:54 and 05:11 UTC**, in a real browser, asking
three questions only: *is there an inventory · how many live ads are visible,
with employer, city and date · which country.*

> **The window first written here was 05:12–05:22 and it named a time that had
> not happened yet.** *It came from a running estimate rather than a clock, the
> third time in this session that a precise-looking time was written from
> memory.* **These two bounds are readings.**

| host | inventory | visible | country |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `kariera.mk` | yes | ~30 on the front page | MK |
| `jobs.af` | yes | **242 active**, employer · city · closing date on each | AF |
| `eshjob.com` | yes | **1 735 results**, 87 pages, newest 16 s old | IQ |
| `iqjscout.com` | **redirects to `yadanoo.com`** | **1 780 live**, per-country | 12, MENA |

> redirect is silent, and the content is internally coherent either way. *A card
> written from here would describe the Swiss edition while believing it
> described the board.*

**That last one is a variable we had not carried: not the country, not the
board — US.** *Every count in this file was taken from one place, and none of
them records where.*

**Re-examined against what was already held: `sptojobslink.com` shows no sign of
it.** *Its URL never changed — root stayed at `/`, listing at `/jobs/` — and its
location filter offers Fiji, Cook Islands, Samoa, French Polynesia, Solomon
Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea and American Samoa **in one list**, which a
single-country edition would not.* **What this does not exclude is IP-shaped
content under an unchanged URL** — *jobstore announced itself by moving; a host
that shaped silently would not, and nothing already held would show it.*

**Two of the seven are not what this file said they were.**

**`www.iraqhire.com` is not a board.** Its own footer reads: *"This is a free
demo result from the Wayback Machine Downloader. It is not a complete
website."* The listing answers `No Record`, and the notice says © 2025. **It is
a resurrected static shell of a dead site** — the `bestzambiajobs` class, where
a `robots.txt` outlives the site that wrote it and nothing in the file says so.

**`iqjscout.com` is now `yadanoo.com`**, a MENA-wide board, not an Iraqi one:
UAE 847 · Qatar 308 · Saudi 191 · **Iraq 163** · Egypt 134 · Jordan 39 ·
Kuwait 28 · Lebanon 24 · Bahrain 21 · Syria 14 · Tunisia 9 · Oman 2, counts the
site states as live. *`iraq-hosts.md` names it as an Iraqi host; it is a
regional one that happens to carry Iraq.*

**And the count for `www.hays.fr` is withheld because the pattern that produced
it was wrong.** `([\d][\d\s,.]*)\s*(offres|jobs|emplois)` returned
`"2026 Offres"` — **the year, adjacent to the word.** *A number matched next to
the right noun is not a count of anything, and it is the shape that gets
published because it looks like a measurement.*

**What this settles about Iraq.** `IQ` had one card, `script: none`, and this
file called its five portals "identified, not reached". **Two of them serve
live inventory to a browser right now** — 1 735 at `eshjob.com` and 163 at
`yadanoo.com` — *and a third, `iraqhire`, serves nothing at all and never
will.* **The country's coverage question is answerable; it was not being
asked.**

### The fact that decides — none of the six is the last of its country

```
hiringcafe · jobstore        countries: *      worldwide meta-boards
www.hays.fr                  FR, 17 other adapters declare France

```

> **NOT RECOMPUTED SINCE, and the population has grown from six to eleven.**

**So opening shape (1) would add six hosts and no country.** *The two hosts

### And the limit of this count, which is the point of it

**Eight is what the repository ATTESTS, not what exists.** *The six of shape (3)
have no card. The four regional hosts of shape (1) live in one sentence of
`hiringcafe.md`. A host measured, refused, and never written up appears
nowhere.*

> **This repository keeps what a session decided to write down, and the rest
> lives in a thread nobody else reads.**

**That is issue #162 on another object, and it has already cost a figure given
to the repository's owner as a basis for decision** — *"nine hosts, seven
countries at zero coverage", served in the morning and not reproducible from
`shared/` by the evening.*

**The count above prescribes, so it expires**: it stops being true the day
anyone writes up one more host. *Re-derive it from the command rather than
quoting this number.*

## A refusal nobody wrote — the vendor default

Question 1 asks whether the refusal is aimed at us. There is an answer none of
the earlier cases produced: **it is aimed at nobody, because nobody wrote it.**

`datos.gob.mx/robots.txt` and `datos.gob.ar/robots.txt`, fetched 2026-09-02:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /dataset/rate/
Disallow: /revision/
Disallow: /dataset/*/history
Disallow: /api/
Crawl-Delay: 10
```

**123 bytes, and byte-identical** — same MD5, `924dd2f6cedd956be8d4888a634876ca`
— on two unrelated national open-data portals. Every path it names is a
**CKAN** route. It is the file the software ships with, and neither
administration has touched it.

**What follows, and what does not.**

- **Obey it anyway.** A rule nobody revisited is still the rule the server
  publishes, and this file's default does not bend for a weak reason. Nothing
  here licenses ignoring it.
- **But do not describe it as a decision.** Writing *"the portal has
  explicitly closed its API"* attributes an intent that the evidence
  contradicts, and that sentence then travels. Say what is true: *the default
  file has not been changed.*
- **It changes the remedy.** A declared refusal is answered by respecting it.
  A default nobody edited is answered by **asking the operator** — an
  open-data portal that has never considered the question may simply say yes.
  That is a route the other cases in this file do not have.

**The tell is provenance, not text.** Finland's `tyomarkkinatori.fi` also
carries `Disallow: /api/`, written by hand into a file with its own structure
and its own other rules. **The same directive, one deliberate and one shipped
in a box.** Nothing in the line distinguishes them; only where the file came
from does. Check whether the whole file is a stock artefact — a known default,
byte-identical elsewhere — before calling any single rule a policy.

*(Measured and reported by claude-job-hunt-8e on the Mexico page, which had
first described it as an explicit closure; re-verified here before being
written down. The correction is the useful half.)*

### The second instance, and it is much larger: Cloudflare Managed Content

Measured 2026-09-02 on two unrelated Singaporean boards, `nodeflair.com`
(tech) and `fastjobs.sg` (non-graduate). Both serve **the same preamble, word
for word**, fenced by:

```
# BEGIN Cloudflare Managed content
…
# END Cloudflare Managed Content
```

Inside: `Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-train=no, use=reference` for
`User-agent: *` followed by `Allow: /`; a citation of **Article 4 of EU
Directive 2019/790** as an express reservation of rights; and then **ten named
agents each given `Disallow: /`** — `Amazonbot`, `Applebot-Extended`,
`Bytespider`, `CCBot`, **`ClaudeBot`**, `CloudflareBrowserRenderingCrawler`,
`Google-Extended` and the rest.

**Question 3 is where this gets interesting, and the earlier phrasing of it
was not sharp enough.** This block *is* even-handed: ten AI vendors, one rule,
no favourite. What it is not is **decided**. The operator of a Singaporean job
board did not weigh Anthropic against Google; a checkbox in a CDN dashboard
did, and the same bytes appear on sites with nothing else in common.

**"Even-handed" and "decided" are two different tests, and a vendor default
passes the first without passing the second.** That distinction belongs in
question 1 as much as question 3: the refusal is aimed at a category, by
somebody who is not the operator.

**The conclusion is unchanged: obey.** No override is proposed here and none
follows from this. What changes is only what we may write down about it —
*"this operator refuses AI agents"* is not supported by the evidence, and
*"this operator has a CDN default that refuses AI agents"* is. As with the
CKAN case, the remedy that opens is **asking**, and the sentence that travels
should be the true one.

### Where it has been seen: eleven sites, eight countries

**Measured by the country surveys on 2026-09-02** (recorded here from those
surveys, not re-measured in this file):

| Country | Sites |
| :-- | :-- |
| Singapore | `nodeflair.com`, `fastjobs.sg` |
| Philippines | `jobslin` |
| Vietnam | `topdev.vn`, `mywork.com.vn` |
| Chile | `getonbrd.com` |
| Kenya | `publicservice.go.ke` — **the first public-sector site to carry it** |
| Egypt | `wuzzuf.net`, `forasna.com` |
| Ghana | `ghanajob.com` |
| Tanzania | `mabumbe.com` |

**The scope is a number, not an impression**, which is what the issue asked
for. Expect it anywhere a board sits behind Cloudflare.

### Three forms, and they do not say the same thing about intent

**1. The block alone.** Fingerprint `c6370d4bc025`, no other rule in the file:
**the operator wrote nothing.** Four sites, three continents.

**2. The block beside the operator's own rules.** Somebody wrote a file, and
the block was added to it. The operator's own lines are their decision; the
fenced ones are not, and the two must not be read as one policy.

**3. The block twice.** `wuzzuf.net` carries the **entire preamble twice** and
names `ClaudeBot` in both. The effect is nil — and it is the proof that the
block is injected without checking whether it is already there. **A rule
written twice by accident is not a rule written twice as firmly.**

### The counter-examples matter as much, and there are as many

**Publishers who do decide mostly decide on cost, not on doctrine.**
`theugandanjobline.com` leaves its engineering log in the file: *"Bingbot made
122 500 requests in three days, 24% of all traffic, four times Googlebot, for a
small fraction of the visits Google sends"* — and **`ClaudeBot` is filed beside
MJ12bot and a competing aggregator: as a cost, not as a threat.** `tazabek.kg`
names **29 agents** under *"AI robots and SEO analysers: total ban"*, with
Claude next to SemrushBot and AhrefsBot. And `bayt.com` blocks `LinkedInBot`
and `IndeedBot` while naming no AI agent at all — **that is competitor
blocking, and it has nothing to do with this argument.**

**A refusal written by hand, at scale.** The HeadHunter family — `hh.ru`,
`hh.kz`, `hh.uz`, `hh.by`, and `zarplata.ru` — names **eight AI agents each**,
barred from the advert pages only, **while `*` keeps explicit access there**,
replicated byte for byte across four countries. Nobody's CDN did that.

**And permissions, written on purpose.** JobKorea allows `ClaudeBot` on its
advert pages by an explicit path whitelist. Trade Me gives it **four groups**
and withholds only commerce. Magneto365 names `ClaudeBot` and `anthropic-ai`
and publishes an `llms.txt`. `qatarliving.com` writes **seven `Allow: /` lines
where `*` already permitted everything** — a redundant permission nobody was
obliged to write. And Tech in Asia (Singapore) and CareerViet (Vietnam) make
six.

**The honest count: eleven restrictive sites against six welcoming ones**, and
the far end of the range is `pe.jobomas.com` — **the only site in the corpus to
block `Claude-User`**, the human-driven agent.

**Both counts come from the same day's surveys and neither is a state of the
web.** Eleven is where the block was *seen*, not where it *is*; six is where a
permission was *written down*, not where we are welcome.

### `ClaudeBot` refused and `Claude-User` unnamed is not a permission

The block names `ClaudeBot` and says nothing about `Claude-User`. **The
omission is not an invitation.** Whoever wrote that list enumerated training
and crawling agents; that a person-driven fetcher was not on their list says
what was in front of them, not what they would have decided.

**And the field shows the distinction is available to publishers who want it**:
Indeed adds `Claude-User` to its widest group deliberately, and `pe.jobomas.com`
bars it outright. **A publisher who means to refuse the user-driven agent can
name it, and one of them did.**

So the rule here is the one `shared/reading-terms.md` already carries and
`softy.md` already practised: **being a user-driven tool is a reason to read an
ambiguous clause fairly, never a reason to argue past a publisher who named
us.** Where the block appears, we obey it.

> **Superseded on 2026-09-07 by the owner, against the pilot's advice, and
> the paragraph above is kept so the reversal can be read.** *`ClaudeBot`
> and `Claude-User` are two distinct tokens; the group naming the first does
> not apply to the second, which is the standard semantics of the file.*
> Where the block names `ClaudeBot` and leaves `*` open, a request goes as
> `Claude-User` by ordinary HTTP. `allowed()` and `identity()` followed on
> 2026-09-07; `verdict()['sweep']` — the gate nineteen adapters ask first —
> followed on 2026-09-11 (#230): it now says `swept as claude-user` and
> still names the record that closed `ClaudeBot`. A refusal by `*` is
> untouched: nothing names us, everybody is refused, the sweep stays closed.

### What this section settles, and what it deliberately does not

- **The block is recognised on sight** rather than read as a bespoke policy.
- **A CDN default is weaker evidence of intent than an operator's own line —
  and exactly as binding.** What changes is the sentence we may write about a
  publisher, never what we do with their file.
- **No override follows from any of it.** Nothing here is a reason to fetch
  anything, and it must not be cited as one.

**And the material does not support a conclusion in our favour.** It supports a
finer question than the one that was asked: *some* refusals are nobody's
decision, *some* are considered and about bandwidth rather than about AI, and
*some publishers say yes in writing when they did not have to.* Anyone tempted
to read this section as leverage should read the Ugandan file's traffic log
first.

## Its counterpart — a body that says nothing does not say no

The section above holds that **a refusal nobody wrote still binds**: Honduras
publishes a file copied out of Google's documentation, and we obey it anyway,
because the wish we are honouring is the host's whether or not the host
composed it.

**The counterpart was owed, and it is this.** A host that answers, readably,
with a body containing **no `User-agent`, `Disallow` or `Allow` line anywhere
in it** has expressed no rule at all. There is nothing to obey. **Refusing it
lends the host a wish it never wrote** — the mirror image of the error the
vendor-default section warns against.

The owner's reasoning, quoted rather than paraphrased:

> *"l'absence de règle est une porte ouverte. Rappel : le fichier `robots.txt`
> est un souhait de l'hôte (qui bien souvent est autogénéré et non vérifié)"*

**Both halves are one position and must be read together.** Written apart, the
first gets cited alone as *"defaults bind"* and the second alone as *"we
proceed when unsure"* — and neither is what this says.

### The states — and since 2026-09-13 every unread file is the same absence

**Owner's decision, #283, 2026-09-13, twice in one hour, verbatim:** *«&nbsp;un
403 sur un robots.txt doit être considéré comme l'absence de règle... et donc
une porte ouverte&nbsp;»*, then *«&nbsp;toutes incapacité d'ouvrir robots.txt
doit aboutir à l'absence de règles et donc à l'ouverture&nbsp;»*. RFC 9309
§2.3.1.3 as written, on every code. The rows that read **stop** until then are
kept struck through, so that the change reads as a decision and not as a gap.

| reading of `/robots.txt` | what the host did | conduct |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **200, a rules file** | wrote its rules | the rules it carries, `certain: True` |
| **404 / 410** (`absent`) | looked, and there is none | **open door**, `certain: True` — knowledge |
| **`unrecognised`** — 200, readable body, no directive line | **answered, and wrote no rule** | **open door**, `certain: False` |
| **`unauthenticated`** — 401 | **demands a credential for everything, wrote no rule** | **open door**, `certain: False` — #201, 2026-09-09, the first code brought back |
| **`no-rules`** — 403, 429, 451, any other 4xx, a 5xx after three attempts, timeout, TLS, connection refused, a 2xx that is not 200 | **nothing was read** | **open door**, `certain: False`, the kind naming what failed (`no-rules-403`, `no-rules-timeout` …) — **#283, 2026-09-13**. ~~`refused` — 403/429/451: answered, and answered no — **stop**~~ ~~`unreachable` — timeout, DNS, TLS, 5xx: we could not look — **stop**, #118~~ |

**What does not change, and it is the whole boundary now:** a `Disallow`
that was READ is a `Disallow`; a refusal at the transport on a PAGE is a
refusal at the transport — the browser candidate of the 2026-09-07 decision,
bornes 0-3 whole; a challenge is not defeated and nobody is asked to defeat
one; a `Crawl-delay` that was read applies; a 429 on a PAGE stops the fetch
(`sapoemprego.py`, 5 s then stop). **The 429 on the rules file says nothing
about the 429 on the listing, and it is the latter that counts.** And «an
INDETERMINATE is not probed» no longer holds for the rules file: a guard that
could read nothing answers `allowed: True, certain: False`, and the transport
decides next.

**The pilot's opinion, given once and kept because it was given:** a 429 on
`/robots.txt` is a host that just said «&nbsp;slow down&nbsp;», and opening it
sends a request back within the second. The conduct that honours that without
contradicting the decision: **on a 429 (or a timeout) of the rules file the
first transport request waits `Retry-After` when the host gives one, else
10 s** — `first_request_delay` on the verdict, honoured by `_pace.Pace` and
`bin/fetch-body.py`; a delay, not a refusal. *#118's argument — a host that
names this project and closes everything to it looks exactly like a timeout
from here, `nea.gov.kh` did — was given, is kept in `_robots.py`'s header, and
does not decide any more.*

### `certain` stays false, and that is not a detail

`allowed: True` with **`certain: False`** is the honest shape. #128 exists
because a body nobody could recognise was once parsed into an empty `*` group
and then **certified**; what this decision changes is *the conduct applied to
an absence*, not *what is known about it*. Those are separable, and the day
they are merged again the seventh defect returns through the front door.

**And this does not reach the keyed API hosts.** `api.francetravail.io`
publishes `User-agent: * / Disallow: /` — an explicit refusal, not an absence —
and `rest.arbeitsagentur.de` answers 403. **Those are the two rows this
decision does not cover**, and the question about them stays open.

### What it lit, measured rather than assumed

**Nothing, on the day it was made** — and that is worth writing down. The two
adapters it was expected to restore, `empleate.py` and `oposiciones.py`, still
return no ads: `empleate.gob.es` serves **the same 8 456-byte SEPE error page
on every path**, `/robots.txt`, `/` and the API alike. The unreadable
`robots.txt` was never a robots quirk — it was one symptom of a host that is
down. **A doctrine expected to relight a board is checked by running the
adapter, never by reading the verdict.**

## When a refused board's ads reach us through an open one

Decided 2026-09-01, on Empléate. It will recur, so it is written down.

`empleate.gob.es` is Spain's public employment service. Its `robots.txt` names
nobody and its search API is open. It is also an **aggregator**: 2 436 of its
28 099 live ads come from **Tecnoempleo**, which the table above rules out
entirely, and the full text of each one is in the record.

**Reading them there is not reading tecnoempleo.com.** `robots.txt` is an
instruction to crawlers about access to *that server*. It is not a licence
term on the content, and it does not follow the content to a third party the
operator chose to supply. Tecnoempleo feeds this register; the register serves
it openly; we read the register. Nothing is circumvented, and the alternative —
treating a syndicated copy as untouchable — would mean discarding ads from a
public body because of a private site's crawler policy.

**The part that does need care is the link.** Those records carry the
partner's own URL, so an adapter that emits it as *the* ad URL sends
`cover-letter <URL>` to fetch a refused host, from the user's own address,
later, with nobody watching. That is the actual violation, and it is one
field away from happening by accident.

**The rule.** When an open board republishes a refused board's ads:

1. **Read them.** The open board is the source of record.
2. **Emit the open board's URL as the ad URL**, always. Never the partner's.
3. **Carry the partner link separately and mark it** — `empleate.md` uses
   `source_url` plus `source_url_do_not_fetch: true` — so nothing downstream
   follows it and the reason is visible in the row.
4. **Make the list of refused hosts inspectable per run.** `empleate.py
   fuentes` prints the flag per feed, so the next partner to appear is seen
   rather than assumed.

**What this does not extend to.** It is about content an operator *published to*
an open third party. It says nothing about a mirror, a scraper's copy, or a
cache — those are not the operator's act. And it never reaches a login, a
paywall, or anything the refused site keeps behind one.

## When the same operator's data is reachable through a host that says nothing

Decided 2026-09-03, on Chile's `practicasparachile.cl`. **It is the mirror
image of the section above, and the two must not be confused.**

`www.practicasparachile.cl` passes the guard: its `/robots.txt` returns the
site's own HTML shell, no rules were read, and **an unreadable file is not a
refusal.** Its offers are not in the page — they are fetched from
`apisqa.empleospublicos.cl`, an API host that publishes **no robots.txt at
all**, so that host permits too.

**And `empleospublicos.cl` — the operator of those records — publishes
`User-agent: * / Disallow: /`.**

**The rule.** When the data behind an open host belongs to an operator whose
own host refuses, **the refusal governs.** Reading the same records through an
API host that merely omits a rules file is **choosing the host that says yes**,
and the omission is a deployment detail rather than a decision. `icims.py`
already warns aloud when an employer's two hosts disagree, precisely so the
convenient one is never picked quietly; this says the same thing about an API
subdomain, a CDN origin, a staging host, or anything else the same operator
runs.

**How this differs from the Empléate case, which is the whole distinction.**
There, a public register serves ads **a third party chose to supply it**: two
operators, and the one we read is the one that published to us. Here there is
**one operator**, and the second host is its own plumbing. *Supplied to
somebody else* and *left unlabelled on my own second machine* are not the same
act, and only the first is a publication.

**The test to apply.** Ask **whose** records these are, not **which host**
answered. If the answer names an operator that refuses anywhere it has spoken
plainly, stop — and record the refusal as the reason, so nobody later reads the
absence of an adapter as an oversight. `chile-public-sector.md` is the worked
example.

## The group that binds you is not always `*`

**`_robots.py` evaluated `*` and never consulted a record naming this
project.** On the Cloudflare managed shape — which is the commonest file in
this corpus —

```
User-agent: *
Content-Signal: search=yes,ai-train=no,use=reference
Allow: /
…
User-agent: ClaudeBot
Disallow: /
```

**it answered *allowed*.** Measured on `www.labour.gov.bb`, and **8 of 89 local
files have that shape: `*` open, one of our tokens closed** — 9%, and all eight
are managed blocks, so **any host adopting the template will be reported open
while closing us by name.** The error went towards permitted, **on the one
category of file that addresses us explicitly.** Issue #116.

**The module betrayed its own assumption in its own message**: *"a refusal
aimed at everyone, **not at a named crawler**"*. It knew named groups existed
and did not look at them.

**Selection now happens before evaluation**, per RFC 9309: a matching token
beats `*`, the longest token wins among several, and records sharing a token
merge. **Our tokens are declared in one place and never derived from a
user-agent string** — a module that decides consent must not change its answer
because an adapter changed its `UA`.

**And the verdict says which group decided.** *"Refused to `ClaudeBot`"* and
*"refused to `*`"* are not the same fact: the first is aimed at us, the second
is a policy. This file makes that distinction everywhere else.

**It finds permissions too, which is the half worth saying.** `taleez.com`
publishes `User-agent: ClaudeBot / Allow: /` and `User-agent: Claude-Web /
Allow: /` — **an operator who considered the question and said yes.** A
selector that only looked for refusals would have missed that, and being named
permissively is not the same as not being named at all.

## Being named has five values, not two

**"Named" is not "blocked", and "allowed" without saying where is as misleading
as "named" without saying which way.** Measured across the country surveys and
verified directly on 2026-09-02:

| Value | What it looks like | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **1. not named** | no group applies; `*` decides | the common case — **and silence settles nothing, in either direction** |
| **2. refused** | `Disallow: /` on our agents | `linkedin.com`, below |
| **3. allowed** | a bare `Allow: /` | `ethiojobs.net`, `ikman.lk` |
| **4. allowed, but restricted** | `Allow: /` for one agent, a narrow permission for another | Indeed: a bare `Allow: /` for `Claude-User` and `Claude-SearchBot`, **pagination only and 145 closed paths for `ClaudeBot`** |
| **5. refused exactly where it counts** | open everywhere except the ads | `hh.ru`: **`Disallow: /vacancy/*`**, and the rest of the site open |

**Value 5 is the one a permissive summary hides**, and value 4 is the one a
restrictive summary hides. A survey that records "named" without recording
which of the five produces a fact nobody can use.

### `linkedin.com` refuses us by hand, including the user-driven agent

**Verified directly, 2026-09-02** — 120 190 bytes, `text/plain`, hand-written
and not a managed block:

```
ClaudeBot        Disallow: /
Claude-Web       Disallow: /
Claude-User      Disallow: /
anthropic-ai     Disallow: /
Claude-SearchBot Disallow: /public-profile/ , /people/search/   ← value 4, not 2
```

**This matters more than any other entry in the file, for two reasons.**

**It settles the question the repository keeps circling.** Indeed separates the
two categories in order to *open* to the human-driven agent; **LinkedIn closes
them alike.** The distinction exists, two major operators have decided it in
**opposite directions**, and therefore **it is a choice and not an emerging
standard.** Nothing here may rest on the idea that an agent acting for a person
is generally accepted — `shared/reading-terms.md` already refuses to argue past
a publisher who named us, and this is the publisher who named us most
explicitly.

**And LinkedIn is cited as a source across nearly every country in the
survey.** A reader who finds this file after us would be right to ask why it
was not written here.

**What the adapter does is a different act, and the file must say so rather
than assume it.** `linkedin.md` drives **the user's own Chrome, in the user's
own session** — that is the person browsing their own account, not one of our
agents fetching. **LinkedIn's file is precisely the document that declines to
draw that distinction**, so this repository states it explicitly instead of
presupposing it, and states equally that **no automated fetch of LinkedIn by
our agents is permitted by that file.**

### A permission that permits nobody

`reed.co.uk` carries, commented and deliberate:

```
# Anthropic (Claude)
User-agent: AnthropicBot
Allow: /
```

**No other site in the survey uses that name.** The five that recur are
`ClaudeBot`, `Claude-User`, `Claude-SearchBot`, `Claude-Web` and
`anthropic-ai`, so a conforming client not carrying it falls back to `*`.

**It is the exact mirror of the anti-scanner file below**: one is a permission
that permits nobody, the other a refusal that refuses almost nobody. **Both
express a real intention and produce no effect, and in both cases a quick
reading gives the opposite of the effect.**

*(The reservation, kept as stated: this does not establish that `AnthropicBot`
does not exist. What is observed is that none of the other twenty-two sites in
the survey uses it — an observation about the corpus, not about our agents.)*

## Two families, and one conclusion: what counts is what you counted

Everything below this line was measured on 2026-09-02, across the country
surveys. **They divide into two families and they meet at one sentence.**

### A. What answers is not a rules file — and no status code says so

Five ways a request for `/robots.txt` returns something that is not one:

| Shape | Where | What it looks like |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **A `403` the browser denies** | eight sites in one day, incl. `104.com.tw` — two md5s for apex and `www`, and its search page loads fine in Chrome | a refusal |
| **A `202` with an empty body** | `tanqeeb` | an answer |
| **An application shell** | a Jordanian LMIS (Next.js), `kemnaker.go.id` (Angular, **825 kB**) | a large permissive file |
| **The home page, on any path** | `topjobs.lk` — **1 133 363 bytes** of the site's own front page, *and an invented URL returns the same* | **a very rich rules file** |
| **A `404`** | two Georgian government portals serving 116 kB and 174 kB of plain HTML elsewhere | a block |

**A `404` on `/robots.txt` is not a refusal — it is the absence of a file**, and
reading it the other way costs a country.

**`topjobs.lk` is the sharpest of the five because it defeats both instincts at
once**: a prober that checks the status sees `200`, and a prober that checks
the *size* sees a megabyte and concludes the file is unusually thorough.

### B. What is declared is not what is there

**A `Sitemap:` that answers is not a `Sitemap:` that contains.** `jordanjobs.net`
declares **twelve**; three were pulled and each returned `200`, `text/xml`,
**413 bytes, zero `<loc>`** — a well-formed `<urlset>` with four namespaces and
an XSL stylesheet, and nothing in it. Then an invented name at the same host
returned **the same 413 bytes, same md5**. **It passes the status check, the
MIME check, the XML validation and the existence check.** Only counting the
`<loc>` elements catches it, and the site is alive — 96 kB of real pages.

**And an identical declaration can mean opposite things.** Two families
publish a sitemap URL carrying an entity id, in files of rigorously equal size
differing by one identifier:

- `hr.ge` / `cv.ge` / `career.ge` — pulled and compared: **39 287 URLs
  strictly identical**, 1 112 ads in common at 100%, files of 5 383 203 bytes.
  **Three brands, one corpus.**

  **Two brands, and a third that was reading someone else's file.** Re-measured
  2026-09-03 through the tenant numbers those sitemaps are served under:
  `hr.ge` is tenant 1 and `cv.ge` tenant 2, both **1 062 advertisements** —
  genuinely one corpus. **`career.ge` is tenant 3 and has none at all**, and it
  appeared here because **its own `robots.txt` declares `tenant/1`**, which is
  hr.ge's sitemap. The comparison was of files, and the files agreed because
  two of the three brands pointed at the same one.

  **And the file was never the ad count**: of those 39 247 `<loc>`, **36 593
  are `/customer/` employer pages** and 1 505 are search landing pages. The
  platform has six tenants, three of which publish ads —
  `shared/boards/hr-ge.md` has the table.
- `ar` / `pe` / `mx.jobomas.com` — `robots.txt` of 2 074 bytes each, one line
  of `diff`, the 172nd: their own sitemap's domain. Pulled: **2 003, 2 796 and
  5 067 `<loc>`**, 45 paths in common — the structural pages. **Three
  countries, three corpora.**

**A rule drawn from either refutes the other.** Together they permit exactly
one sentence, and it is the same one as Taleez's 296-of-14 221:

> **The declaration says nothing. Pull the files and count the URLs.**

**And the counter-example belongs here too, or the rule reads as cynicism.**
`www.trabajo.gob.ec` declares `sitemap_index.xml` from inside its Yoast block,
and it is **real**: `200`, `text/xml`, 1 585 bytes, **seven sub-sitemaps**.
Verified 2026-09-03. Against the three ghosts already catalogued — `mol.gov.om`
in `404`, `jordanjobs.net` valid and empty, `lmis.mol.gov.jo` an application
shell — that is **three ways of lying and one of telling the truth**. The rule
was never "sitemaps are worthless"; it is **"you do not know until you count"**,
and a corpus with no true case cannot say that honestly.

**Then the second half, which the count alone does not give you: real is not
relevant.** The seven files are `post`, `page`, `ads_banner`, `ps_promotion`,
`category`, `ads_banner_cat`, `author` — **a WordPress content sitemap, and not
one of them is vacancies.** Counting `<loc>` here returns a confident number
about a ministry's news articles. **A count answers "is anything there"; only
the filenames answer "is it the thing you came for"** — the same arithmetic
that would have reported Vieclam24h five times over by counting its occupation
and province families as ads.

**A fourth brand for the `_bum` filename evidence**, measured the same day:
`multitrabajos.com` (Ecuador) declares five sitemaps and **all five end in
`_bum`** — `sitemap_avisos_bum.xml`, `sitemap_core_bum.xml`,
`sitemap_empresas_bum.xml`, `sitemap_listados_ubicacion_bum.xml`,
`sitemap_tags_bum.xml`. The Bumeran marker survives under a brand whose name
shares nothing with it, exactly as it did under Laborum and Konzerta. **And the
files are real**: `avisos` is 1 158 822 bytes and carries **5 771 `<loc>`**.

**The pair on one market is the instructive part.** On Ecuador,
`multitrabajos` betrays its group in its own filenames and `computrabajo`
declares **no `Sitemap:` at all** — same country, same trade, and only one of
them can be settled this way. **A method that decided `hr.ge` and Jobomas has a
domain of validity, and this is its edge.** A non-result that bounds a method
is worth more than a third example confirming it.

### Files nobody wrote, and the asymmetry that identifies them

The managed-block section above assumes a CDN. **Five more routes produce a
rules file that no operator wrote:**

- **The CMS default.** `mlvt.gov.kh`, a labour ministry, serves the
  `robots.txt` shipped with Joomla — installation comments included, still
  explaining how to move it if the CMS sits in a subfolder, still linking
  `robotstxt.org`. **Not one line is about the site.**
- **The online generator.** `camhr.com`, 154 bytes stamped
  `# robots.txt generated at …`, carrying an empty `Disallow:` followed by two
  real ones.
- **The framework module.** `hahu.jobs` — **114 bytes** fenced by
  `# START nuxt-robots (indexable)` and `# END nuxt-robots`, an empty
  `Disallow:`, and a `Sitemap:` the module derived from the site's own base
  URL. Verified 2026-09-03 — **and only over a redirect**: the apex answers
  `301`, and a fetch without `-L` returns 178 bytes of nginx HTML, which is a
  `robots.txt` in neither content nor type.
- **The CMS plugin.** `www.trabajo.gob.ec`, the Ecuadorian labour ministry —
  **176 bytes** fenced by `# START YOAST BLOCK` and `# END YOAST BLOCK`, an
  empty `Disallow:`, one `Sitemap:` that is real (below). Verified 2026-09-03.

- **The documentation itself.** `empleate.gob.hn`, Honduras's public
  employment service — **394 bytes that are Google's own help page, verbatim**,
  including the headings:

  ```
  # Example 1: Block only Googlebot
  # Example 2: Block Googlebot and Adsbot
  # Example 3: Block all crawlers except AdsBot …
  ```

  Somebody copied the three worked examples, replaced the paths, and shipped
  the comments with them — including example 3's, which describes a case the
  file does not implement.

  **And it is the only one of the six that produces an enforceable refusal.**
  The others leave a neutral file or a third party's block; this one carries
  `User-agent: * / Disallow: /Vacantes/` — valid, applicable, and aimed
  precisely at the vacancies. **The intention behind a directive does not
  change its effect**, which is the rule this file already applies to
  `akhtaboot` and to the Cloudflare blocks, here in the direction that costs
  us. Issue #101.

**The five look nothing alike, and that is the finding.** One is the same
Cloudflare block byte-for-byte across eleven sites in eight countries; another
is 176 bytes that shout their origin in comments at both ends. **The plugin
route is the most verbose of the five**, which inverts the intuition that a
default is terse: a generator that signs its work leaves *more* text than an
administrator would have written, not less. A reader looking for "short and
generic" finds three of the five and misses two.

**What they share is not infrastructure, not size and not tone — it is that a
rules file exists without anybody having wanted one.** That is visible only
with the five side by side, which is why the list is kept and not just the
rule.

**Identify them by content, never by fingerprint, and the asymmetry is the
point.** An identical md5 against a known default establishes it; **a different
md5 establishes nothing**, because one line added by an administrator changes
the hash without changing the nature of the file. **An equality concludes, an
inequality only opens a check** — the same shape as *absent is not a refusal*
in `_robots.py`.

*(Fingerprint comparison failed in both directions on one day: two identical
files that looked different because of a `Sitemap:` line, and a shared managed
block that made two unrelated governments look like one decision.)*

### Three files that mean the opposite of how they read

**A tiny `Disallow: /` is not always a content policy.**
`job.taiwanjobs.gov.tw` — the Taiwanese public employment service — is **34
bytes**:

```
User-Agent: ZoomEye
Disallow: /
```

There is **no `User-agent: *` group at all**, so nothing else has an
applicable group and everything is permitted. **The named adversary is a
network-asset scanner, not a crawler and not an AI**: this is a security
posture, not a content policy, and **it is the only file in the corpus that
misleads in the permissive→restrictive direction** while the others mislead the
other way.

**A welcoming file can close the one function that matters.**
`labourdept.gov.lk` is fully commented in English, in four numbered sections,
with a bandwidth-cost vocabulary — *"These bots drain bandwidth but don't bring
you search traffic"* — and **names no AI agent at all**. Section 3 contains
**`Disallow: /*?*`**, which forbids every URL carrying a query string. On a
WordPress site, that is the job search. **Read the patterns, never the tone.**

**And a file can say yes, on purpose, with a business reason and a date.**
`ikman.lk`:

```
#AI Assistant Crawlers - explicitly allowed for AI/GEO visibility (added per Q3 2026 GEO OKR)
```

…followed by **nine agents in `Allow: /`** — ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, GPTBot,
ChatGPT-User, PerplexityBot, Perplexity-User, Google-Extended, OAI-SearchBot,
meta-externalfetcher — **and `meta-externalagent` in `Disallow: /` right
after**. Somebody separated two robots from the same publisher and decided
differently for each; that is not a copy-paste.

**Read it as what it is: the site describing itself in its own file.** What is
verifiable is that its structure matches what it announces.

#### And the nine do not include the token we send

**`Claude-User` is not among them.** The file names `ClaudeBot`,
`Claude-SearchBot` and `anthropic-ai`; the identity a fetch from this project
carries by default is the one it does not name. **So our request falls to `*`,
whose group carries about forty `Disallow` patterns** — every URL with
`?query=`, `?sort=`, `?filters=`, `?utm_source=`, and the account paths.

Measured 2026-09-08:

```
path                    claude-user   claudebot   the guard resolves to
/                          True          True       *
/jobs/colombo              True          True       *
/jobs?query=engineer       False         True       claudebot
/en/ads?sort=date          False         True       claudebot
```

**The explicit permission is real and it is narrower than it reads**: bare on
the named agents, and bounded by the `*` exclusions for the one we send.
*`_token_agents` already prefers `claude-user` and falls back where it is
refused, so the identity presented here changes with the path* — which is the
decision of 2026-09-05 working, and observable rather than assumed.

**This is the mirror of the case this file records at «a refusal addressed to a
name we do not send».** *A permission addressed to a name we do not send is
worth exactly as little, and it is easier to miss because the summary is
flattering.* **Read which agent, not just which direction.**

*The same file also closes four — `CCBot`, `Baiduspider`, `Sogou`, `BLEXBot` —
under one group, and asks in a comment that its `robots.txt` and its
`llms.txt` be «kept in sync». It is a curated list, not an open door.*

**And it settles a question the file left open.** `akhtaboot.com` names nine
agents to close them all; `ikman.lk` names nine to open them all — **same day,
same corpus.** Two deliberate and opposite postures, **and neither is its
market's default**: three Jordanian boards out of four have no AI policy at
all. **A reference board does not represent its market on this question. Two
boards suffice to check that; none suffices to assume it.**

### An `llms.txt` says nothing about what is in it

Both bounds are in the same corpus, on the same day: one is **7 637 bytes of
real documentation** — category tree, URL template, district list, a note that
the site renders server-side — and another is **a GoDaddy sales pitch**. **The
directive is not evidence of content.** Open it or say you did not.

### And the identity check has two holes

Reading a page's `<title>` to confirm a domain is what it claims — a rule born
from mistaking a personal portfolio for a job board — **fails twice**:

- **A client-rendered application sets its title in the browser.**
  `buscojobs.com.ar` has **no `<title>` at all** for a plain fetch and is a
  perfectly real site; its identity is in `og:title`, `<html lang="es-AR">`
  and the meta description.
- **A site behind a WAF returns the challenge's title** — *"Just a moment…"*,
  *"Security Check"*.

**An absent title refutes nothing, and a WAF's title is not the site's.** Read
`og:title`, `og:site_name`, `<html lang>` and the meta description before
concluding. **An empty title is not an empty site.**

### A guessed hostname is a hypothesis, and confirming the concept does not confirm the address

**The failure of #72 has a form that survives the check meant to catch it.**
Ecuador's public employment service was looked for at **`socioempleo.gob.ec`**
— a name assembled from what the programme is called. It has **no DNS record**
(verified 2026-09-03). The obvious next step is to confirm the concept, and the
concept confirms: *Socio Empleo* is real, it is the name of the deployed
application, and it is served — at
**`encuentraempleo.trabajo.gob.ec/socioEmpleo-war/paginas/index.jsf`**, 73 761
bytes, `200`.

**So the search returns evidence that you are looking for the right thing, and
none that you are looking in the right place** — and the natural reading of the
two together is *the right service, at a domain that has died*. It has not; it
never had that name.

| Guess | What answered | Why it misleads |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `hirejordan.com` | A site, and not the one claimed | A name that resolves is not a name that is right |
| `sajil` / `sajjil` | Nothing | A spelling slip — caught by re-reading |
| **`socioempleo.gob.ec`** | **Nothing, while the concept checks out** | **The concept check succeeds and is mistaken for an address check** |

**This one is not caught by re-reading, because there is nothing misspelt.** It
is caught one way only: **read the official site's outbound links**, which is
where `encuentraempleo` was found. A hostname that was never observed is a
hypothesis until a link from an authority carries it — and *"the domain is
dead"* is a claim about the world that needs the same evidence as any other.

## The same file is a source of coordinates, and reading it only for permission leaves them

Everything above is defensive: what may be fetched, what a refusal means, when
a file is not a file. **Three findings on 2026-09-02 point the other way.**
Issue #74.

**1. It names the coordinate the adapter was guessing.** Every Workday tenant's
file carries one `Allow:` line per career site it has opened. Swisscom
publishes **three**; `resolve` finds **two** through a meta-board. The employer
had been publishing the answer all along, and `workday.py sites` reads it.

**2. It names where the duplicates are.** `workventure.com` hides from
Googlebot a set of feed files **named after the boards it syndicates to** —
`indeed.xml`, `jooble.xml`, `careerjet.xml`, `incruit.xml`. Read for
permission, that is a list of paths to avoid. **Read for information, it is the
board saying where its own ads will appear again**, which is what a ledger
needs in order to deduplicate.

**3. It names a directory an adapter file said did not exist.** `solique` and
`taleez` both declared a sitemap at the standard path, under a permissive file,
and both turned out to be tenant or ad directories. **Nothing was hidden; the
file was read for whether we could fetch and not for what it said was there**
(#72).

### Accessible is not intended, and the names do not say which

Novartis's Workday tenant names **`Internal_Careers_for_Acquired_Entities`**
beside its public site. **A tenant lists what it has opened to robots, not what
a candidate should read**, and the difference is invisible from the name alone
— which is why `workday.py sites` now says so out loud when a name reads
internal, and still only enumerates.

**Enumerating is not choosing.** A name found this way is a **candidate, never
a target**.

### Three ways this goes wrong, all measured the same day

**A `Sitemap:` line is a declaration, not an inventory.** It announces URLs. It
does not say they exist, that they resolve, or that they are adverts.
**Counting sitemap entries as ads produces exactly the class of number
`shared/plausible-and-false.md` exists for** — and Taleez's own sitemap was
read at 296 of 14 221 by a regex that matched only one slug shape, while
reporting success.

**Two formats defeat a naive reader.** AllJobs writes its `Allow:` paths in
**`%uXXXX`** — a notation removed from the URL specification: it is legible and
it does **not** compare equal to a normally-encoded URL without conversion.
And `jobmaster.co.il/jobs/` sits in a **redirect loop on the trailing slash**
that `curl` abandons at the fiftieth hop. **A discovery that follows the paths
it finds needs a hop bound and a defined behaviour when it hits one** — the
answer being *stop and say which path looped*, never *treat it as absent*.

### And the case that must not be read in our favour

`jobmaster.co.il` **names `Google-Extended` and `ChatGPT-User` in order to
allow them, and does not name any Anthropic agent.** The generic `*` group is
permissive, so a mechanical reading lands on *allowed*.

**Do not let the fallback settle it.** A site that took the trouble to
enumerate agents and did not enumerate ours has expressed something the generic
group does not represent, and **the honest description of that state is "not
addressed", not "permitted"**. It is the mirror of the case in the managed-block
section above, where an omission was equally not an invitation: **an omission
is not a decision in either direction, and it is certainly not a decision in
ours.**

The question of what a user-driven agent may do where it was not named stays
open in this repository. **It is not closed by silence, and least of all by
silence read our way.**

### The rules

1. **Read the file for what it names, not only for what it forbids.**
   `Sitemap:` lines, `Allow:` paths and the names of disallowed files are
   coordinates.
2. **A name found this way is a candidate, never a target** — show it, and let
   the user choose, especially where the name suggests an internal audience.
3. **Record where a coordinate came from.** *"Published by the employer in
   their own `robots.txt`"* is stronger than *"resolved from a meta-board"*,
   and where the two disagree — Swisscom, three against two — the employer's
   own file is the one to believe.
4. **Nothing in this section is a permission.** It changes what we may *learn*
   from a file, never what we may *fetch* from a host that refused.

5. **A `Sitemap:` may name a different host, and following it is a fetch of
   that host.** `merojob.com` declares its sitemaps on `sg.merojob.com`,
   gzipped, measured 2026-09-04. **That address escapes both instruments at
   once**: it is not in the card's `<!-- hosts: -->`, and the guard was asked
   about `merojob.com`. So following such a directive requires a verdict on the
   host that will actually be fetched, and that host declared on the card. It
   is the apex/`www` lesson generalised — two names, two hosts, two possible
   rules files — except that here **the second address is named by the first,
   so it is discoverable before it is needed.**

   *Prospective: `_sitemap.py` receives bodies, never URLs, and the only place
   that extracts `Sitemap:` at all — `workday.py:225` — prints the lines rather
   than following them. No adapter fetches a third-party sitemap today. The
   rule is written now because a defect behind an absence cannot fail until
   someone writes that adapter, and then it surfaces as a fresh breakage.*

6. **A sitemap index is not a list of advertisements, and neither is a sitemap
   of advertisements.** Two Nepali boards, measured 2026-09-04, mix tenders
   into their listings and do it differently:

   - `merojob.com` puts `sitemap-tender_post-1.xml.gz` — **15 940 tenders since
     2017** — beside `sitemap-job_post-1.xml.gz`'s 239 jobs, siblings in one
     index. An adapter reading "every sitemap in the index" would report
     **16 179 jobs instead of 239**.
   - `jobsnepal.com` has no such separation: **55 of the 177 entries (31 %) of
     a file named `jobs-sitemap.xml`** are `invitation-for-sealed-bids`,
     `request-for-proposal` or `expression-of-interest`. **No filename filter
     reaches that case at all.**

   **The filename promises; it does not attest** — the rule already written for
   routes, applied to sitemaps. So **what enters a count is justified, and what
   is excluded is counted too**: a number that silently drops 31 % is
   indistinguishable from one that had nothing to drop.

   *Filtering exists today but is per-adapter and ad hoc — `_sitemap.locs()`
   takes a `contains=` and each of its ten callers decides alone; `ssge.py`
   sets aside `sitemap-listing-*` as search-filter URLs, `jobstore.py` keeps
   `/job-\d+\.xml$`. Nothing shared said an index could hold anything but
   ads.*

7. **Three signals could tell an advertisement from what sits beside it. Only
   the PATH decided.** Measured on Nepal's three readable boards on
   2026-09-07, one adapter each:

   ```
   kumarijob    /<employer>/<id>-<slug>   against two files of FACETS
   merojob      /<slug>  vs  /etender/    15 940 tenders set aside
   merorojgari  /job/<slug>/              200/200 · 200/200 · 183/183
   ```

   - **The NAME sorts nothing, and it fails in both directions.** On
     `merojob.com` a filename that does not say "job" holds 15 940 tenders; on
     `kumarijob.com` two that DO say job — `sitemap-job-listings.xml`,
     `sitemap-other-job-listings.xml` — hold only facets. **A filter built
     against one lets the other through**, and reading every file whose name
     says job would report 227 there against a true 167.
   - **`lastmod` sorts FACETS from content and NOT the natures.** It looks like
     a predicate and the counter-example is plain: `sitemap-tender_post-1.xml.gz`
     carries `2026-09-02`, as recent as the jobs file's `2026-09-07`. *Both
     regenerate. On `kumarijob.com` it does separate — the facet files are
     frozen at 2026-05-22 — which is exactly why one board is not enough to
     adopt it.*
   - **The PATH sorted all three**, and it is the only one that did.

   **Report the rejection with a COUNT, never assume the named file is
   clean.** *`merojob.py` prints how many entries under `/etender/` it dropped;
   `0 of 239` is the check reporting that the file stayed what it was named,
   and a non-zero would be the file changing under us. "The filter worked" is
   not a measurement.*

   **AND THE DENOMINATOR IS THREE BOARDS IN ONE COUNTRY.** *Three of three in
   one market is not three of three in the world — the same warning this file
   carries about a rule that held four times in Africa and fell in Nepal. The
   path is what to TRY first, not a law.*

8. **A sitemap date is not the advertisement's date, and it lies differently on
   every board.** Same three boards, same day, three distinct failures:

   ```
   kumarijob    the FILE's date          2 values over 167 entries
   merojob      an INERT middle layer    an ad posted 09-07 is listed 09-04
   merorojgari  the entry is EARLIER     an ad posted 07-31 listed under 07-20
   ```

   **`merojob` is the sharpest**: its index says the child regenerated at
   `2026-09-07T03:00`, the child's own entries say `09-03` and `09-04`, and the
   advertisements span `08-24` to `09-07`. **Three layers, and only the deepest
   is true** — the middle one is neither the regeneration nor the posting, and
   it is the one a reader takes for a date.

   **So `--since` is refused without `--fetch` on all three**, in code, with
   exit 8. *A filter on a listing date returns all or nothing on two of them and
   silently drops live advertisements on the third — and looks like a working
   filter in every case.*

   > **The conclusion is not "sitemap dates are wrong". It is that none is
   > believed without being checked against the advertisement.**

## Which commands ask the host, and which do not

**Every command that reads advert content asks first.** Measured coverage,
2026-09-02, across the eight families whose tenants have their own hosts:

| Family | Guarded | Not guarded |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Workday | `sites`, `list`, `ad` | `facets`, `resolve` |
| Taleez | `jobs`, `ad`, `sitemap` | — |
| Personio | `jobs`, `check` | — |
| umantis | `list`, `ad`, `check` | — |
| SuccessFactors | `list`, `ad`, `check` | `locale` |
| Oracle Cloud | `search`, `read` | `sites` |
| iCIMS | `list`, `ad` | `resolve` |
| Teamtailor (`ats.py`) | the listing path, so `list` and `ad` both | `resolve` |

**The unguarded ones read no advert.** `locale`, `sites`, `facets` and
`resolve` answer *what is this host* and *what does it offer* — a question
about the service, not a use of its content. Guarding them would also make a
refusing tenant undiscoverable, which helps nobody: **better to identify a host
and then refuse it loudly than to be unable to name what was refused.**

**`sitemap` is guarded, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.**
Enumerating a closed set does what the closure exists to prevent — the same
reasoning the Belarus survey applied when it declined to count ad sitemaps
sitting outside a disallowed path.

**And `check` is guarded because it is the one `cover-letter` calls when
somebody applies.** A tenant that wrote `ai-input=no` is refusing the content,
not the pagination.

## Terms of use are a different instrument, and they are read elsewhere

This file governs **machine-readable refusals**. A board's terms of use are
prose written for many readers at once, and the question there is which reader
a clause is addressed to — a harvesting clause and an anti-automation clause
look alike and do not bind alike. **`shared/reading-terms.md` holds that rule**
(issues #48 and #81).

**It opens no door in this one.** A `robots.txt` refusal stands whatever a
board's terms say about resale, and no reading of a prose document is a reason
to revisit the four questions above.

## `Content-Signal` says what a use may be, where our tokens say who we are

**A new axis, and the first host that uses it against a use is on record.**
`www.portaljob-madagascar.com`, read 2026-09-07, serves the Cloudflare managed
block with:

```
User-agent: *
Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-train=no, use=reference
Allow: /
```

and the file states, above it, that **any restriction expressed this way is an
express reservation of rights under Article 4 of EU Directive 2019/790** on
copyright in the digital single market.

**This is orthogonal to everything else in this document.** `ClaudeBot` and
`Claude-User` answer *who is asking*; `Content-Signal` answers *what the
content may then be used for*. **A host can permit the request and refuse a
use** — this one does exactly that, since its `*` group carries `Allow: /`.

### Our reading, and it is not a loophole

**`ai-train=no` is not this project's use.** This repository reads job
advertisements on behalf of a person who is looking for work, presents them to
that person, and **trains nothing**. `use=reference` is the value that covers
reading a document to refer to its contents, and `search=yes` covers indexing
them for retrieval.

*So the signal permits what we do and refuses something we do not do.* **We
comply by continuing to not do it**, which is worth stating plainly rather than
leaving as an absence.

### The part that will not rediscover itself

> **Anyone who later wants to train a model on a corpus gathered by this
> project must treat `ai-train=no` as already answered: no.**

**This is the only half of this section that needs writing down.** The
permission side re-derives itself from the file on the next read; *the refusal
does not, because the day someone reaches for this corpus as training data
they will not re-read the `robots.txt` files of September 2026.* **A corpus
outlives the signal that governed it**, and a `Content-Signal` obeyed once at
fetch time is not obeyed forever by accident.

**A host carrying `ai-train=no` therefore taints its rows for that purpose
permanently**, whatever else those rows are later merged into. If a corpus
cannot say which host each row came from, it cannot honour this — which is a
further reason the provenance rules in this repository are not bookkeeping.

### Prevalence: one

**One host, found on 2026-09-07 while re-measuring a card.** Nothing here says
how many carry it, and the signal is recent enough that the answer would be
different next month. *Do not extrapolate from one, and do not treat its
absence elsewhere as a permission — a file that says nothing about a use has
neither granted nor restricted it, which the specification states in its own
words.*

## A third party's broken infrastructure is not ours to fix — with one exception

Decided 2026-09-03, on `empleate.gob.es`. **The general rule is the short
one: an operator's infrastructure faults are the operator's.** The plugin
reports them and moves on; it does not carry workarounds for other people's
servers, and every one it carried would be a thing to maintain for ever.

**The exception is narrow and it turns on who feels the fault.** When the
defect is **masked for ordinary web users** — so the operator has no symptom,
no complaint and no reason to correct it — **and an alternative exists that
keeps verification intact**, take the alternative.

`empleate.gob.es` sends its leaf certificate and no intermediate. Browsers
never notice: they cache intermediates from other sites and fetch the missing
one from the `AuthorityInformationAccess` extension. Every verifying client
refuses it, so the plugin is the only thing that breaks, and **waiting for a
fix means waiting for a symptom that will not appear.**

**The alternative taken: supply the intermediate the leaf's own AIA names**, for
those two hosts only. The same chain is verified, to the same root, out of the
same store. `skills/job-scan/scripts/_tls.py`.

**Three conditions, and they are what make it an alternative rather than a
shortcut:**

1. **Verify before embedding, and not by the name on it.** Fetch from the AIA
   URL, confirm the subject is the leaf's issuer, and check that it actually
   verifies the leaf against a root the default store already holds
   (`openssl verify -untrusted`). All four were done and recorded in the
   module.
2. **Carry it narrowly.** A store augmented for the named hosts. `context_for()`
   returns `None` for every other host, which means *use the default*. Nothing
   is trusted more widely, and the host list is a set — not a suffix match.
3. **Plan for its expiry, out loud.** An embedded certificate lapses. On that
   day the failure must **name itself** — *"the intermediate embedded for … 
   expired on …"*, with the AIA URL to fetch a fresh one — rather than
   returning as an opaque `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` and making somebody
   repeat the whole investigation. The date is read **from the certificate**,
   never from a constant beside it.

**And the boundary, which no wording of a request moves: `verify=False` is
never the alternative.** It does not fix the connection in front of you; it
removes the check from **every** connection the plugin makes, including the
ones nobody was asking about. A repository-wide test fails if `CERT_NONE`,
`_create_unverified_context`, `check_hostname=False`, `verify=False` or
`--insecure` appears anywhere in the code — **pinned, because a sentence in a
document waits for a reader.**

## Which scripts do not ask the guard, and why — written down, not deduced

**An absent guard call is indistinguishable from a decision not to call.** That
is what went wrong with SmartRecruiters in `ats.py`: the exception existed
nowhere. So the list lives in the test suite (`EveryNetworkReaderAsksOrSaysWhyNot`)
with a reason per entry, and a script that stops asking without being added
fails.

**#100 counted ten by grepping for `robots`, and that measure passes prose.**
`arbeitsagentur.py` and `hiringcafe.py` mention the word in a docstring — one
of them carrying **a human's one-time reading of the file**, which is the very
practice `_robots.py` exists to replace — and neither calls the guard. **Six
network readers do not ask, not four.**

**Five tooling scripts make no network call at all**, verified rather than
assumed: `achievements`, `board_offer`, `dormant`, `employers`, `ledger`. A
test asserts it, because "it only reads the ledger" is the kind of claim that
quietly stops being true.

**And the assumption was wrong once.** `tenant_offer.py` was grouped with them
and **sends HEAD requests through up to eight redirects.** The tempting
exemption — it retrieves no content and follows a link the user supplied, the
`Claude-User` class — **is refuted by `www.linkedin.com`**, whose file names
`Claude-User` and closes everything to it. **Being user-directed is not an
exemption; it is a class operators address.** It asks now, per host and per
path, and reports *not identified* rather than *no provider*.

### The open question: does a keyed API consult the guard?

**Not decided here.** Both readings are defensible — a `robots.txt` is still
the operator's will, and an issued key is a contract more specific than a
generic file — and `adzuna.py` already carries the second argument in its own
user-agent string.

**What is decided is that the measurement is on the record:**

```
api.adzuna.com                                Disallow: /        REFUSES
api.francetravail.io                          Disallow: /        REFUSES
labonnealternance.apprentissage.beta.gouv.fr  6 paths closed     permits
jobsearch.api.jobtechdev.se   (platsbanken)   404 — no file      permits
arbeitsagentur.de                             opens everything   permits
```

**Two of the five publish `Disallow: /` on the very host the plugin reads with
the user's key** — the same shape as `api.smartrecruiters.com`, which
`robots-policy.md` treats under its own question. **That is an arbitration for
the user, not a fix**, and nothing here has been changed on the strength of it.

## What this file does not license

Not credentials, not paywalls, not consent walls, not anything a login guards,
and not personal data of any kind. **The AMS override covers public job
advertisements and nothing else.** Candidate profiles, employer contact
records and anything behind the eJob-Room's authentication are out of scope
here and stay out.

And it does not license quiet reinterpretation of the four questions to reach a
convenient answer. **If the reasoning has to be strained, the answer is obey.**
