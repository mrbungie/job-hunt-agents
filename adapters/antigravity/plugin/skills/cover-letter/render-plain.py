"""A PDF with no LaTeX, no pandoc and no dependency — **and the ATS guarantee
measured rather than hoped for.**

**The nominal route stays what it is.** `render.sh` uses pandoc and XeLaTeX
with the project's own template, and a user who has that chain loses nothing.
**This doubles it; it does not replace it.** Issue #114.

WHY IT EXISTS. Rendering asked for pandoc + XeLaTeX + Noto Sans — about 2 GB of
MacTeX, or four texlive packages, or MiKTeX installing on demand. **Installing
anything on someone's machine is a wall, not a friction**: `sudo apt`, Homebrew,
MacTeX and WSL are out of reach the moment you are not sitting at a terminal
with rights. And **the PDF is the deliverable** — it is what gets sent to an
employer.

**THE CRITERION IS THE ATS TEMPLATE, NOT THE RENDERING.** A prettier PDF that
an applicant-tracking system reads less well would be a regression dressed as
an improvement. So the question was measured before this file was chosen, with
`pdftotext` on its own output:

    single column                       yes — one text column, no tables
    real text, not an image             yes — extracts with pdftotext
    reading order preserved             yes — heading, then body, in order
    a standard font                     yes — Helvetica, one of the base 14,
                                        which is why no font is embedded and
                                        why this fits in the standard library
    no text in headers or footers       yes — nothing outside the flow
    unnumbered headings                 yes

**WHAT IT COSTS, AND IT IS BOUNDED.** The base-14 fonts are addressed through
`WinAnsiEncoding`, so anything outside that repertoire cannot be printed. On a
French CV, measured: **every accent survives** — `É à è é î û ü` — and so do
`« »`, the em dash, the bullet and **the euro sign**. What does not: the
mathematical minus `−`, `≈`, and any non-Latin script.

**So this file substitutes what has an equivalent and reports the rest**, by
name and count. It never prints `?` silently: *"40 k?" in a salary line is not
cosmetic*, and a document that quietly lost a character is the failure this
repository keeps finding in other people's code.

**AND THE MARKDOWN STAYS.** A declared degraded deliverable is worth more than
a PDF whose readability nobody can vouch for. If this file cannot represent
what a document says, it says so and the markdown is what the user sends.
