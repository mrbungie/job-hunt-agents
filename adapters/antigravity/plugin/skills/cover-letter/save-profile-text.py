"""Save a profile page's text straight into `profile/.text/` — no print dialog.

**Printing five pages to PDF is the first place people stop, and the repository
says so.** `README.md` names it as the abandonment point, and three things make
it expensive:

- **The truncation is silent.** A page that was not scrolled to the bottom
  prints a valid, incomplete PDF. No error, a poorer record, and a resume
  missing jobs.
- **The print dialog is a real wall.** It is a native window; no automation
  crosses it, here or anywhere.
- **And the PDF is not what is used.** Only the *text* is consumed downstream,
  from `profile/.text/`. The PDF is an imposed intermediate whose useful
  content is extracted afterwards. Issue #111.

So the nominal route is inverted: **read the pages in the user's own browser,
in their own session, and save the text.** Same content, no printing, no
dialog — **and the truncation disappears, because nothing depends on a manual
scroll any more.**

    python3 save-profile-text.py experience --stdin < text
    python3 save-profile-text.py skills --from-file /tmp/skills.txt

The name is one of the five the pipeline knows, so a `.text/` written this way
is indistinguishable from one built by `sync-sources.sh`, and every downstream
check — `grep -ril '<term>' profile/.text/` — works unchanged.

**LOGGING IN FOR THE USER IS OUT OF SCOPE AND STAYS OUT.** The reading happens
in *their* browser with *their* session, which is already how the LinkedIn
adapter is designed and what `shared/robots-policy.md` records: LinkedIn
refuses this project by name, including the user-driven agent.
