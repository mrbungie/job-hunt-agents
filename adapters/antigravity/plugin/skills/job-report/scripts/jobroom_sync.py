"""Work out what job-room still needs, and refuse to write a duplicate into it.

Two jobs, deliberately in one script because they share the ledger parsing and
because doing only the first one is unsafe:

  plan   what to declare, and what to correct — the delta, not the whole board
  check  does this candidate row already exist in job-room? — the hard gate

A PRE (preuve de recherche d'emploi) is an official declaration to an
unemployment office. Two entries for one application is an inaccurate
declaration; a missing one is a search that does not count. Both errors are
invisible in a row count, so neither is left to judgement here.

The script never talks to job-room: that space is authenticated and lives in
the user's own browser. `check` is fed the page text the caller already has.
