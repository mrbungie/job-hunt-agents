"""Fetch Thai ads from JOBBKK — where page 5 000 answers 200 with page 5's ads.

Thailand's largest board by volume. **No key, no cookie, no browser**:
`robots.txt` is 275 bytes of `text/plain`, identical on the apex and on `www`,
and closes résumés, uploads, mail, captchas and `/jobs/apply/` — **nothing on
the listings, and no AI agent named**.

  GET /jobs/lists/<page>/หางาน,<keyword>,<province>,<category>.html
      → 200 text/html, ~1.2 MB, 25 result cards
  GET /jobs/detail/<company_id>/<jobpost_id>
      → 200 text/html, the ad, with an `application/ld+json` JobPosting

THE LISTING IS THE PAYLOAD. The page is a Next.js app and its flight data
carries **the whole record for each of the 25 cards** — `jobpost_id`,
`company_id`, `company_name`, `position`, the duties text, province, district,
`gmap_la`/`gmap_lo`, `salary_start`/`salary_end`, `job_format_type`,
`employment_type`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. One request buys 25 ads, so a
sweep costs one request per 25, not 26.

PAST THE END, THE BOARD REPEATS THE LAST PAGE FOR EVER. Measured on
*โปรแกรมเมอร์* (programmer) 2026-09-02:

    page 4     25 cards, distinct
    page 5     25 cards, distinct  ← the last real page
    page 200   the same 25 cards as page 5
    page 500   the same 25
    page 5000  the same 25

**No 404, no empty list, no error.** A sweep that pages until it gets nothing
back never stops, and every extra page adds 25 duplicates it has already seen.
This script compares each page's ids with the previous page's and stops when
they repeat — that is the only end-of-results signal this board gives.

The wall is **per search, not global**: *บัญชี* (accounting) and the unfiltered
listing were still returning distinct pages at page 20.

THE PAYLOAD SENDS A SALARY THE EMPLOYER ASKED TO HIDE. `salary_not_show` is
`"1"` on 18 ads of 133, and **17 of those 18 also carry `salary_start` and
`salary_end`**. The site does not display them. This adapter does not emit
them either — `salary_withheld: true`, and no figure. Reading a field the
operator sends is fair; publishing one it was asked to hide is not.

AND THE PAGE CARRIES A "NO RESULTS" MESSAGE WHILE SHOWING RESULTS. The Thai
string *ขออภัยไม่พบตำแหน่งงานที่คุณค้นหา* — "sorry, no position found" — is in
the served HTML of a page with 25 ads, in a hidden template. **Never decide
emptiness by searching for it**; count the cards.

Everything here was verified against the live site on **2026-09-02**.
