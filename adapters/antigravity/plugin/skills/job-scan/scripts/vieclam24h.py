"""Fetch Vietnamese ads from Vieclam24h — 110 fields per ad, and the adapter
reads sixteen of them on purpose.

One of Vietnam's largest boards. **No key, no cookie, no browser**: every
search page carries its results in the page's own `__NEXT_DATA__`, and
`robots.txt` — 356 bytes of `text/plain` — declares a sitemap index whose job
files hold **17 089 ad URLs**.

  GET /tim-kiem-viec-lam-nhanh?q=<terms>&page=<n>
      → 200 text/html; `props.initialState.api.getJobList.data`
        30 items a page, with `total_items` and `last`
  GET /file/sitemap/sitemap-index.xml → the sitemap families
  GET /<category>/<slug>c<c>p<p>id<id>.html
      → one ad; `props.initialState.api.jobDetailHiddenContact.data`, 110 keys

THE RECORD CARRIES OTHER PEOPLE'S CONTACT DETAILS, ON EVERY AD. Measured on 90
ads, 2026-09-02:

    employer_info    present on 90 of 90   (43 keys, incl. the board's own
                                            account manager, named)
    contact_name     filled  on 90 of 90
    contact_email    filled
    contact_phone    filled
    contact_address  filled

These are a named recruiter's direct details and a named salesperson's, not
job data. **A pipeline ledger is a file on somebody's disk that gets pasted
into issues and backed up**, and none of that belongs in it.

**So this card is an allow-list, not a deny-list.** It names the sixteen fields
it emits and copies nothing else, which means a field added to the payload
tomorrow cannot leak through it. Dropping `employer_info` by name would have
left `contact_email` behind — the deny-list was tried first, on paper, and it
missed four fields out of five.

**Nothing is lost.** Applying goes through the ad URL, where the employer
publishes what it chose to publish, to a person who is applying.

COUNT THE SALARY ON VALUES. `salary_min` and `salary_max` are present as keys
on **90 of 90** and carry a real figure on **89** — 98.9%, not 100%. The
difference is one ad, and the habit is the point: on this repository's other
boards the same slip has been worth 80 points.

A BARE `curl` IS REFUSED AND AN ORDINARY BROWSER IS NOT. The ad page answers
**403** to a plain request and **200** to the same URL with an ordinary
`Accept`/`Accept-Language` pair. It is header sniffing rather than a bot wall
— nothing in `robots.txt` refuses this — so the script sends what a browser
sends and nothing more.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-02**.
