"""Count and read `<loc>` elements — the one reader, because there were
thirteen.

**Issue #55 measured the cost.** `hays.fr` wraps its URLs:

    <loc>
          <![CDATA[ https://www.hays.fr/description-emploi/… ]]>
    </loc>

The usual `<loc>\\s*([^<\\s]+)` matches **nothing at all** here — the first
non-space character after the tag is `<`. On a **valid, 200-OK, 2.37 MB**
sitemap it returns **zero URLs**: a board that appears to publish nothing.

**What exposed it was arithmetic, not the code**: the same file yielded 3 193
`<lastmod>` and 0 `<loc>`. A sitemap with dates and no URLs is impossible.
Had it carried neither, nothing would have said a word.

**AND THE FIX WAS PASTED INSTEAD OF SHARED, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.**
Audited 2026-09-03: **13 scripts read `<loc>`. Seven carry the corrected
pattern — five of them with the same comment block copied verbatim — and five
still carry the naive one.** #55 fixed four adapters and left the rest, because
there was nowhere for the fix to live. *Two places that say the same thing
eventually disagree*; thirteen places is not a style problem, it is a defect
generator.

THREE WAYS A POPULATED SITEMAP READS AS EMPTY, and this handles all three:

- **CDATA**, above.
- **The whole file on one line.** `grep -c '<loc>'` counts **lines**, not
  elements: a 91-URL sitemap served without newlines is reported as **1**.
  Measured on a government sitemap, 2026-09-03.
- **A namespace prefix** — `<ns:loc>`, `<sitemap:loc>` — which a pattern
  anchored on `<loc>` misses entirely.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it is not an XML parser, and deliberately. These files are
routinely served with a wrong content type, truncated, or gzipped-and-labelled-
text; a strict parser raises where a reader should return what is there and say
what it could not read. `count_says` is the sentence for that.
