"""Fetch job ads from job-room.ch, the Swiss public employment service portal.

job-room.ch is run by SECO. Its search backend is a plain unauthenticated REST
API — no key, no cookie, no browser — and it carries the ads that employers
subject to the Swiss vacancy-reporting duty must publish, plus ads harvested
from other boards.

Usage:
  jobroom.py search --canton VD [--canton GE] [--keywords "infirmier"]
                    [--online-since 7] [--sort date_desc] [--pages 3]
  jobroom.py search --lat 46.5197 --lon 6.6323 --radius 20
  jobroom.py ad <uuid>

Output: one JSON object per line (search), or one JSON object (ad).
