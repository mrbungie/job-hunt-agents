"""What this plugin says it is, in one place. Issue #120, point 1 of #124.

**The repository obeyed `Claude-User`'s rules and announced Chrome.** 63 files
carried `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) …` while
`_robots.OUR_AGENTS` already bound the guard to `claude-user`, and
`shared/boards/job-room.md` argued its position in as many words:

    This adapter does not crawl that path: it reads the portal's own public
    API, unauthenticated, a handful of times, for one user's own job search.

**That is the `Claude-User` class exactly** — and an operator reading the
request saw a Chrome browser. The decision on #120 (2026-09-03, by the
repository's owner) is to declare it, because the mechanism in #124 cannot
branch on *"`Claude-User` is allowed"* without it.

**DECLARING CHANGES WHAT WE SEND, NOT WHAT WE OBEY.** The guard has bound this
project to `claude-user` rules since #116; nothing in coverage moves because
of this file. What moves is that an operator can now recognise us, apply a
rule to us, and have it take effect.

**AND ONE CONSEQUENCE NOBODY HAS RAISED, WHICH LANDS ON THE USER.** Anthropic
publishes `https://claude.com/crawling/bots.json` so that operators can verify
its agents — and it contains **IP prefixes and nothing else**: no user-agent
strings, only `216.73.216.0/22` and some /32s. **This plugin runs on the
user's own machine, from the user's own address, which is not in that list.**
An operator who matches the token and then checks the address will find a
mismatch, and the reading available to them is *spoofed*.

**So the token is carried inside a string that says plainly what this is.** It
names the plugin, its version and its repository. An operator matching
`Claude-User` in a `robots.txt` group gets the behaviour the decision intends;
an operator reading the string sees that this is a personal tool on a personal
machine, not Anthropic's fleet. **Both readings are true, which is the only
arrangement worth sending.**

If a host that used to permit us starts refusing after this, that must be
visible on the day — `shared/never-fail-silently.md` — not discovered in a
count that quietly shrank. `blocked_note()` is what says it.

    then reaching for a browser at every refusal would be **worse than not
