"""eJobsFiji (`ejobsfiji.com`) — Fiji's second board, and a small one.

  ejobsfiji.py list [--fetch] [--since 2026-08-01] [--live] [--limit 20]
  ejobsfiji.py ad --id 1120

**Nine advertisements in a sitemap of 397 URLs.** The other 388 are 377
company pages, 6 blog posts and the site's own static pages.

    /companies/…  377      /blogs/…   6      /jobs/…   10      static  4
    /jobs/view?id=<n>   9   <- the advertisements

*Fiji's country page recorded fourteen on 2026-09-04.* Both counts are of the
same thing three days apart, and neither corrects the other.

**Nothing has been published here since 2026-08-03** — thirty-five days at the
time of writing. The board is open, readable and quiet, which is three
different facts from «broken».

THE IDENTIFIER IS IN THE QUERY STRING

`/jobs/view?id=1120`. **The guard is taken on path *and* query** via
`full_path()`, which exists because 54 of this repository's 55 call sites once
took `parts.path` alone and would have asked a refused path without seeing it.
Here the query is not merely part of the URL — **it is the whole of the
identity**, since every advertisement shares the path `/jobs/view`.

The schema states the same number in `identifier.value`, and this module
prefers that when present: *a number the board publishes about itself beats
one we parsed out of a URL.*

DATES ARE REAL AND SPREAD, UNLIKE ITS NEIGHBOUR'S

    9 advertisements · 9 with `lastmod` · 6 distinct dates · 2026-05-29 → 2026-08-03

**So `--since` works on the sitemap alone**, and one request answers it.
*`myjobsfiji.md`, the other Fijian board, stamps all 3 152 of its entries with
one rebuild date and cannot do this.* **Two boards in one country, and the
same field is load-bearing on one and worthless on the other.**

*The busiest day carries four of nine, which is 44 %. That number is not
reported as a concentration ratio: at n = 9 it is four advertisements, and a
percentage would dress a count as a rate.*

IT SHARES AN ADVERTISEMENT WITH THE OTHER FIJIAN BOARD

Its most recent posting — Ram Sami & Sons, *«Heavy PSV Driver (Class 5)/
Salesman/Driver (Class 2)/ Merchandiser (Nakasi Area)»* — is also on
`myjobsfiji`, whose slug is the same title. **The two boards are not
independent**, and the measured overlap is recorded on both cards rather than
guessed from one example.

Verified against the live site on 2026-09-07.
