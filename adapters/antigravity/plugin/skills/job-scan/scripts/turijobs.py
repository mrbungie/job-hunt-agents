"""Fetch Spanish hospitality ads from turijobs.com — and count how many
people already applied.

**2 863 active ads** in tourism and hospitality — hotels, kitchens, front
desk, spa, housekeeping. The fourth Spanish adapter here and the first
sector board: `empleate.md` and `oposiciones.md` are the SEPE's registers,
`infoempleo.md` is a generalist. Tourism is the sector the generalists cover
worst in Spain, and this is where the chains post.

  GET /robots.txt                         → nine Sitemap: lines, one per locale
  GET /es/sitemap/index.xml               → nine files
  GET /es/sitemap/active-offers.xml       → 2 863 ads, a real lastmod on each
  GET /es/oferta-trabajo/<city>/<slug>/<id>   → the ad, inside __NEXT_DATA__

**No browser, no account, no key.**

WHAT IT HAS THAT NOTHING ELSE HERE DOES. `applies` — **the number of people
who have already applied**, median 10, up to 156. No other board in this
repository publishes it, and it answers a question a candidate cannot
otherwise ask: is this a queue of three or of a hundred and fifty.

It also carries a **real postcode on 38 of 40** — where `infoempleo.md` and
`hays-fr.md` have none at all — plus coordinates, the employer's own street
address, and the employer's careers site.

THE SALARY FIELD READS THREE DIFFERENT WAYS AND ONLY ONE IS TRUE.

    salary object present                    40 of 40   →  "100% have a salary"
    salaryVisible: true                      27 of 40   →  "67% have a salary"
    a figure: salaryMin or salaryMax > 0      2 of 40   →  5%

`salary` is **never absent** — it is an object on every ad, so a presence
check reports total coverage. `salaryVisible` is true on two thirds — and
**25 of those 27 carry `salaryMin: 0, salaryMax: 0`**. `salaryType` says
`YEAR` on 26 ads, of which 2 state an amount: even the unit is filled in
where there is no number.

This is `infoempleo.md`'s `value: 0.0` one level worse: there the zero sat in
a sub-field, here the whole object is present *and* a boolean says it is
visible. Only `> 0` is a salary; everything else is emitted as absent, with
the flags kept so nobody re-derives this.

THE EMPLOYER IS NAMED, AND NOT WHERE YOU WOULD LOOK. `company.name` **does not
exist** — 0 of 35. The name is in `company.brandName`, filled on 35 of 35:
Meliá, Barceló, Catalonia Hotels, H10, Hilton Barcelona. A reader that asks
for `name`, which is what every JSON-LD board here uses, gets `None` on a
board that names the employer on every single ad.

And these are the **real employers**, not agencies — the opposite of
`infoempleo.md`, where 32 of 44 were ETTs. The concentration is in the chains
instead: 16 distinct employers across 35 ads, Meliá alone 15.

A LOCALE IS NOT A COUNTRY. The `/es/` sitemap is the Spanish-language board,
not the Spanish one: **10 of 40 sampled ads were outside Spain** — Germany 4,
Portugal 3, France, Italy, Mexico. Same lesson as `wttj.md`, at two and a half
times the rate. `--pais ES` filters on the ad's own `countryISO`, and every
run reports the split.

Usage:
  turijobs.py ciudades
  turijobs.py search --ciudad barcelona --pais ES
  turijobs.py search --desde 2026-08-25 --limit 30

Output: one JSON object per line.
