"""Fetch ads from an Applifly tenant — where a query parameter you would strip
as tracking is the one that renders the page.

Applifly is a Swiss ATS. **Employers front it with their own vanity domain**
(`jobs.<employer>.ch`), so **the host never says Applifly; the path does** —
`/job/view-job.php` and `/jobs.php`, with `source=` in the query. That is the
same topology `shared/modules/ats-open-check.md` records for SuccessFactors,
and it is why this adapter takes `--host`.

  GET /jobs.php?language=<xx>&source=<any>              → the listing
  GET /job/view-job.php?id=<n>&language=<xx>&source=<any>  → one ad
  GET /sitemap.xml                                      → four landing pages
                                                          (no ad URLs)

**`source=` IS LOAD-BEARING, AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE TRACKING.** Measured on
`jobs.meanquest.ch`, 2026-09-03, on one ad id:

    ?id=1453                                  200      718 bytes   no ad
    ?id=1453&language=fr                      200      718 bytes   no ad
    ?id=1453&source=applifly                  200       99 bytes   no ad
    ?id=1453&language=fr&source=applifly      200  204 739 bytes   THE AD
    ?id=1453&language=fr&source=zzz           200  204 486 bytes   THE AD
    ?id=9999999&language=fr&source=applifly   302                  gone

**The value is irrelevant; the presence is not.** And the 718-byte body is not
an error page — it is a script that reads `document.referrer` and reloads the
same URL with `?source=<referrer>` appended. **A browser therefore always
sees the ad and a script never does**, while the status line says `200` every
time.

**So this is not client-side rendering and it does not need a browser** — which
is what it looks like, and what the first reading concluded. It needs one query
parameter. `shared/robots-policy.md`'s *decide by layer* is the rule: a browser
would fix it, so it appears to be a browser-layer problem, and the cause is one
layer above.

**AND THE ADVICE THAT WOULD BREAK IT IS ALREADY IN THIS REPOSITORY.**
`shared/boards/job-room.md` says of an `externalUrl`: *"Strip the query string
before storing or comparing."* Right for a dedup key, **fatal for a fetch**:
here the id lives in the query, and dropping the parameter that looks like
attribution turns a 204 KB ad into a 718-byte shell that answers `200`.

THE AD IS MICRODATA, NOT JSON-LD. `itemscope itemtype=".../JobPosting"` with
twenty `itemprop`s including coordinates — and **zero `ld+json` describing the
job**. A `grep JobPosting` says yes and a JSON-LD parser says no, on the same
complete posting. `_microdata.py` exists for this.

**The title comes from `<title>`, not from the microdata.** The page's
`<h1 itemprop="title">` wraps a hidden `Organization` block and a submit
button, so the spec-correct value reads *"Meanquest SA Cheffe / Chef de projet
IT Envoyer"*. Measured, not assumed.

ONE TENANT MEASURED. A web search for the template on other hosts returned
nothing, which **establishes nothing about how many exist** (#72): it is one
deployment, said as one deployment. Everything here that could be tenant-local
is marked.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
