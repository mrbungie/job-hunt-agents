  jobsbotswana.py ad --slug workshop-manager-bango-trading

**367 in the sitemap, and the site lists about 5 123.** The sitemap is a recent
slice, not the board: the listing reports `Showing 1–15 of 5123 jobs`, its
pagination runs to page 342 (342 × 15 ≈ 5 130), and **page 342 carries
advertisements dated eight and nine years ago** — one of its eleven links is in
the sitemap. So 367 is roughly the last nine months of a nine-year archive.

*This module first documented `367 advertisements` as the size of the board.
A single-file sitemap with no duplicates and no gaps looks complete, and
completeness is not what that demonstrates.*

**367 advertisements in the sitemap, and it holds 368.** The extra entry is
`/jobs/` — the listing page itself, sitting among the advertisements. Counting
the file length reports the board one larger than it is, which is small here
and was 183-against-180 on `caglobalint.com` and 32-against-30 on `onape.td`
the same night. **Three boards, three different ways of not being their own
file length.**

WordPress with the Noo Jobmonster theme: `/sitemap_index.xml` declares sixteen
children and `noo_job-sitemap.xml` is the only one of advertisements. The other
fifteen are two of companies, one of products, four of taxonomies, and the
rest pages and posts.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-09-05

    noo_job-sitemap.xml   368 <loc>, 368 distinct, 367 advertisements
    dates                 31 distinct, 2025-12-10 → 2026-09-04
                          357 of 367 dated within thirty days

**`lastmod` equals `datePosted` on ten of ten checked**, so the sitemap's date
is the posting date and not a regeneration stamp. That had to be checked:
`myjobsfiji.com` gave every one of its entries the same `lastmod`, and a
freshness count taken from it would have been a count of one afternoon's
rebuild. *Its count lives in `myjobsfiji.md`, dated; it is not copied here.*

**Expired advertisements stay in the file.** Of the ten oldest, five have a
`validThrough` in the past. `--live` filters on it; without the flag everything
is returned and `valid_through` travels with each row.

THE EMPLOYER IS USUALLY REAL AND SOMETIMES THE SITE

`hiringOrganization.name` reads `Jobs Botswana` — the site itself — on **2 of a
random 20**. The other 18 name a genuine employer.

**The rate came out at 62 % on the first sample and 10 % on the second**, and
the difference is the sampling: the first was the last eight entries of the
file, which are one poster's batch of trade vacancies. **A contiguous slice
from one end of a sorted file is not a sample**, and this adapter's figures
come from `random.sample`.

The site's own name is emitted as written with `employer_is_site: true`, never
as `None`: *"the board did not name an employer"* and *"we could not find one"*
are different facts.

FIELDS, ON TWENTY ADVERTISEMENTS

    title · employer · datePosted · validThrough · jobLocation   20/20
    employmentType    FULL_TIME 18, CONTRACTOR 2 — real, and emitted
    baseSalary        0/12 — never present
    industry          10/12, and it mixes sectors with job titles
                      ("Construction", but also "Driver", "Sales Manager")

**`employmentType` is emitted here and is not on `keejob.py`**, where it reads
`OTHER` on every advertisement. Same field, same schema, opposite worth: **what
a field is worth is a property of the board, not of the vocabulary.**

`industry` is not emitted. A field that holds a sector on one row and a job
title on the next cannot be filtered on, and passing it through would invite
exactly that.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-05**.
