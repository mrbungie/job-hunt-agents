"""Enumerate the Bumeran/Jobint family — seven brands, one shape, and the ad
page needs a browser while the directory does not.

**One platform wearing national brands**, and the tell is in the filenames:
every brand serves `sitemap_avisos_bum.xml` at the same path — `_bum` for
Bumeran, surviving under names that share nothing with it. A checksum would
never have found it.

MEASURED 2026-09-03, and **the count is the reason this file exists**:

    bumeran.com.pe      Peru        34 809 ads
    laborum.cl          Chile       15 901
    bumeran.com.ar      Argentina    6 804
    multitrabajos.com   Ecuador      5 771
    konzerta.com        Panama       2 814
    bumeran.com.mx      Mexico       1 795
    bumeran.com.ve      Venezuela      757
                                   ───────
                                    68 651

**DISCOVERY IS PLAIN HTTP AND READING AN AD IS NOT.** The ad page answers
`200` with **64 180 bytes** of React shell — `<title>` empty, no `og:title`,
no `ld+json`, and a `<noscript>` reading *"You need to enable JavaScript to
run this app"*. **Fifty-six characters of visible text.** The facet pages are
the same shell, byte for byte.

**And this one is not a missing parameter.** Applifly looked identical from one
request and was fixed by adding `source=`; here the check was run —
`/api/...` under four shapes answers **403 with the same 5 516 bytes every
time, including for a path that cannot exist.** *An identical size across four
probes is agreement produced by nothing having answered*, so the 403 says the
edge blocks `/api`, not that an endpoint is missing. `robots.txt` does not
mention `/api` at all: this is a WAF rule and not a refusal.

WHAT YOU GET WITHOUT A BROWSER, AND IT IS NOT NOTHING:

- **Every ad's URL and id**, 68 651 of them across seven countries.
- **The slug**, which carries words from the posting — *filterable, and it is
  not the title.* This file emits `slug_words` under that name and never as
  `title`, because nothing here has read the title. Believing a slug is a
  title is how a row gets the right words and the wrong claim.
- **The board's own facet vocabulary** — province, city, area, subarea,
  contract, seniority — parsed from 3 953 listing URLs. **Language-independent
  where a keyword is not**, which is the answer `_zero.py` asks for when a
  search in the user's own language returns nothing.

A NAME THAT LOOKS LIKE THE FAMILY AND IS NOT. `laborum.pe` serves a
`robots.txt` with an entirely different vocabulary — `/myprofile`,
`/wishlist`, `/postulations` — and **no `_bum` sitemap at all**. It is not in
`SITES` and it is named here so nobody adds it on the strength of its name.

AND THE TENANTS ARE NOT IDENTICAL. `bumeran.com.mx` and `bumeran.com.ve`
declare **four** sitemaps where the other five declare five: no
`sitemap_tags_bum.xml`. Small, and exactly the assumption to avoid — Indeed is
one template on forty-nine hosts, SuccessFactors serves two URL shapes by
tenant.
