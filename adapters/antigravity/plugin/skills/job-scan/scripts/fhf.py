"""Read emploi.fhf.fr — France's public hospitals and medico-social sector.

The Fédération Hospitalière de France's own board: CHUs, centres hospitaliers,
EHPADs, USLDs, EPSMs. **13 175 ads** on the day this was written, from nurses
and aides-soignants to hospital directors, IT and finance.

Server-rendered Drupal, no JSON and no JSON-LD, so this parses HTML. What makes
that safe: the fields are named after Drupal **field machine names**
(`field--name-field-publish-date`) on the list, and after **visible French
labels** (*"Etablissement"*, *"Personne à contacter"*) on the ad — neither is
theme decoration, so both survive a redesign the way a class like `.col-md-4`
would not.

Three things it gives that most boards do not:

  * **a full postal address on every ad** — establishment, street, postcode,
    town: 36 out of 36 sampled. That is the field the `job-room-ch` module
    records as the one most often missing from a PRE;
  * **a named contact** — a person, their role, their line — on half of them;
  * **the employer itself**, never an intermediary. The board belongs to the
    hospitals' own federation.

And one thing worth knowing before trusting a number from it: **the first page
is served from a cache that was four days old when measured.** See `bust`.

Usage:
  fhf.py list [--search infirmier] [--category SOI] [--department 69]
              [--contract CDI] [--structure 1561] [--posted-within-days 14]
