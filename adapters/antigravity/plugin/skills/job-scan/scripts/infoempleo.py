"""Fetch Spanish ads from infoempleo.com — a generalist board, and a bad liar.

**7 621 active ads**, the third Spanish adapter here and the first that is not
a public register: `empleate.md` and `oposiciones.md` are both the SEPE's, and
this one is a private generalist board covering the whole country.

  GET /robots.txt              → two Sitemap: lines, one of them empty
  GET /sitemap-index.xml       → the real list
  GET /sitemap-ofertas-activas.xml   → 7 621 ad URLs, no lastmod
  GET /ofertasdetrabajo/<slug>/<place>/<id>/   → the ad, JSON-LD JobPosting

**No browser, no account, no key.** `robots.txt` names no crawler and no AI
agent; its 73 `Disallow` rules close faceted search under `/trabajo/`, the
training section and `/login/`, and leave `/ofertasdetrabajo/` open.

Everything here was verified against the live site on 2026-09-01.

THE TRAP THAT OUTLIVES THE BOARD — and it is not deterministic, which is what
makes it dangerous. **The site answers `Content-Encoding: deflate` on a
fraction of requests, unsolicited**, and the fraction is decided by which
backend takes the call. The same URL, same headers, same minute:

    try1  enc=deflate  raw= 39 057  →  decoded 159 803  ld+json blocks: 4
    try2  enc=deflate  raw= 39 057  →  decoded 159 803  ld+json blocks: 4
    try3  enc=-        raw=159 579  →                   ld+json blocks: 4
    try4  enc=-        raw=159 579  →                   ld+json blocks: 4

Six of eight came back deflated in one run, two of forty-five in the next.

A client that does not decompress does **not** get an error. It gets 37 111
characters of mangled bytes that decode with `errors="replace"`, carry no
`<script>` tag, contain no `JobPosting`, and read exactly like *an ad page with
no structured data*. HTTP 200, correct content type, plausible length.

So the failure is silent, intermittent, and **never reproduces on the same
ads** — a spot-check passes, and a re-run "fixes" a different subset. Measured
naively it reported 5 of 45 ads as carrying no structured data; measured with
the body decompressed, **44 of 45 do**, and the one that does not is a
genuinely expired ad.

This is the gzip trap of `jobindex.dk` and the CDATA trap of `hays-fr.md` with
the one property both of those lacked: it comes and goes. `read()` below always
decodes, and `card()` treats **zero ld+json blocks** — not "no JobPosting" — as
a failure to read, because a real ad page here always carries three or four.

THE SECOND ONE IS THE PREVIOUS RELEASE'S LESSON, INVERTED. `hays-fr.md` records
that the pay sits in `baseSalary.value.value` where four other boards use
`minValue` / `maxValue`. Here:

    "baseSalary": {"value": {"value": 0.0, "minValue": 22000.0,
                             "maxValue": 30000.0, "unitText": "YEAR"}}

`value.value` is **0.0 on every salaried ad measured** (9 of 9), and the truth
is in `minValue` / `maxValue`. An adapter written from the most recent lesson
in this repository reports **€0 on every ad that states a salary**. Read the
object, not the sub-field that worked last time.

Usage:
  infoempleo.py lugares
  infoempleo.py search --lugar madrid --limit 20
  infoempleo.py discover --lugar barcelona

Output: one JSON object per line.
