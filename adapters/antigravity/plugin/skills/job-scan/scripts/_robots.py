"""Read one host's robots.txt before sweeping it — because on a per-tenant ATS
the policy belongs to the tenant, not to the platform.

**Measured 2026-09-02, and this is why the module exists.** Three Teamtailor
tenants, same platform, same product:

    investengine.teamtailor.com  Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-train=no, ai-input=yes
    oatly.teamtailor.com         Content-Signal: search=yes, ai-train=no, ai-input=yes
    polestar.teamtailor.com      Content-Signal: search=no,  ai-train=no, ai-input=no
    normative.teamtailor.com     Content-Signal: search=no,  ai-train=no, ai-input=no

`teamtailor.md` records the first line **as the platform's policy**. Two of the
four tenants say the opposite, and `ai-input=no` is a tenant asking not to be
read into an AI system — which is what this plugin does, on a user's behalf.

No script in this repository read a tenant's `robots.txt` at runtime before
this one. The policy was read once by a person, written into a board file, and
applied to every tenant of the family afterwards.

**Where this matters and where it does not.** Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby and
Workable serve every tenant from one API host — `boards-api.greenhouse.io`,
`api.lever.co`, `api.ashbyhq.com`, `apply.workable.com` — so one file governs
the family and reading it once is right. Teamtailor, Workday, Taleez,
Personio, umantis, SuccessFactors, Oracle Cloud and iCIMS give each tenant its
own hostname, so each tenant can answer differently, and two of six iCIMS
hosts sampled served `Disallow: /` outright.

Use `verdict(host)` and act on it. It fetches once per host per process.

**`sweep` AND `allowed` HAVE THREE VALUES, NOT TWO** — `True`, `False` and
`None` for *the rules could not be read*. That is issue #118, and it was the
worst defect this module has had:

    nea.gov.kh                  allowed=True   "no rules were read"
    barbadosjobregister.gov.bb  allowed=True   "no rules were read"

`nea.gov.kh` serves Cloudflare's managed block with `User-agent: ClaudeBot /
Disallow: /` — **it closes everything to this project by name**. The module
answered *yes* to it, not because it misread the file but **because it never
got the file**: a timed-out request produced `state: unreadable`, and the
reason said so honestly while the boolean said `True`.

**Measured on the same host within the hour**: when the fetch succeeded,
`allowed: False`, group `claudebot`. When it timed out, `allowed: True`.
**The permission was a function of the network, not of the policy.**

That is #72's pattern on the most sensitive object in the repository: *the
value and its validity travel separately, and only the value crosses the
function*. The value was "no rule matched"; the state was "I could not look";
the caller read the boolean.

**`None` is the fix and it is a small one, because `None` is falsy.** A caller
that writes `if not v["sweep"]: refuse` fails closed, and so does one that
writes `if v["sweep"]: fetch`. **Both naive readings become the safe one**,
which is the only kind of default worth relying on across sixty adapters.

The states a fetch can end in, and they are not interchangeable:

    read         the rules are here
    absent       404 — no file published. **Not a refusal**, and this is the
                 one case where silence really is permission
    no-rules     403/429/451, any other 4xx, a persistent 5xx, timeout, TLS,
                 connection refused — **the rules file could not be read,
                 and since 2026-09-13 (#283) that is an absence of rules**:
                 open, `certain: False`, the kind naming what failed
                 (`no-rules-403`, `no-rules-timeout` …). Until then 403, 429
                 and 451 were `refused` — «the host answered, and it said
                 no» (`barbadosjobregister.gov.bb`, 403, "Request is Blocked
                 by Firewall", #118) — and the rest `unreachable`. Owner's
                 decision, twice, verbatim below
    unauthenticated
                 401 — **a credential is demanded for everything, the rules
                 file included.** No file was read and none is presumed:
                 an absence of rules, `certain: False`. Owner's decision of
                 2026-09-09, #201 — the first code brought back
    unreachable  the in-flight state between two of the three attempts —
                 a timeout, a 5xx, **a 2xx that is not 200** — and never
                 the verdict: the last attempt lands in `no-rules` (#283)
    unrecognised 200 with something that is not a rules file — **an open
                 door**, because the host answered and wrote no rule. Still
                 `certain: False`: a body nobody could recognise establishes
                 nothing, and this is a policy applied to that absence, not
                 an absence established

**AND A BODY WE DID NOT RECOGNISE IS NOT AN ABSENCE OF RULES.** Until #128 a
`Content-Type` containing `text/plain` skipped the body check entirely, so
`maliemploi.org`'s Apache *"Access forbidden! / Error 403"* page — served
under that label — was parsed as rules, yielded no `Disallow`, and came back
`allowed: True`, `group: *`, **`certain: True`**. A group invented out of an
error page and then certified.

**The issue read it as the verdict depending on body size**: 976 bytes
accepted, a 5 132-byte React shell rejected. **It is not the size.** The short
one was labelled `text/plain` and never examined; the long one was labelled
`text/html` and was. **The header decided and the body never got a look.**

`certain` exists to say *this is an established absence of rules*. **A guard
that errs by doubting is repairable; a guard that errs by asserting gets
itself believed.**

**That `certain` survives the decision that opened `unrecognised`.** What
changed is the conduct applied to a body without rules, not what is known
about it — the two are separable, and #128 exists because they were once
merged. **A verdict of `allowed: True` with `certain: False` is the honest
shape here**: we are proceeding on a policy, not on a finding, and anything
reading this module can tell the two apart.

**A 404 AND A 202 WITH AN EMPTY BODY ARE NOT THE SAME FACT**, and they shared
a verdict until #125. `algerie.tanqeeb.com` answers **HTTP 202 with zero
bytes**; that landed in `unreadable`, `unreadable` was read as an absence, and
the guard returned `allowed: True` giving the reason *"a 404 is an absence"* —
**a status that never occurred, quoted as the justification.**

A `202 Accepted` says the request was taken and processing is not finished. It
is not a representation of `robots.txt`, and an empty body states nothing. **A
404 is knowledge — the host looked and there is no file.** The three-valued
output added in #118 was right; this branch was not using it.

**And it is the operator, not Algeria.** The Algerian host is the one that
produced the fix; it is not the one that has the behaviour. Four country
subdomains answer identically **and so does the bare apex `tanqeeb.com`**, which
is not a country, so a per-country explanation is ruled out. Measured
2026-09-05, #155, and written up in `shared/boards/tanqeeb.md` — **a dated
observation, not a property of the site.**

**Every reason now quotes the status and the byte count actually observed.** A
silent verdict invites suspicion; **a falsely-motivated one reads like a
verification**, which is worse.

**THE 403 RULE WAS A DELIBERATE DEPARTURE FROM RFC 9309 — AND IT IS THE
STANDARD SINCE 2026-09-13, OWNER'S DECISION (#283).** §2.3.1.3 is explicit:
on a status in the 400-499 range a crawler "MAY access any resources", *as
if no robots.txt existed*. From 2026-09-04 to 2026-09-13 this module refused
on 403, 429 and 451 instead, on the argument that a firewall answering
*blocked* answers a different question than file availability, and that the
cost of being wrong is not symmetric. **The owner decided otherwise, twice
in one hour, verbatim:** *«&nbsp;un 403 sur un robots.txt doit être
considéré comme l'absence de règle... et donc une porte ouverte&nbsp;»*, then
*«&nbsp;toutes incapacité d'ouvrir robots.txt doit aboutir à l'absence de
règles et donc à l'ouverture&nbsp;»*. So:

    200, a rules file         the rules it carries, certain: True
    404 / 410                 absence of rules, certain: True — the host looked, there is none
    EVERYTHING ELSE           absence of rules → open, certain: False — nothing was read
      401                     `unauthenticated` (#201, 2026-09-09 — the first code brought back)
      403, 429, 451, 4xx      `no-rules`, kind `no-rules-<code>`
      5xx, timeout, TLS,      `no-rules`, kind `no-rules-timeout` / `-tls` / `-connection` / `-http-<code>`,
      connection refused      after the three attempts a transient failure gets

**What does not change:** a `Disallow` that was READ is a `Disallow`; a
refusal at the transport on a PAGE is a refusal at the transport (the
browser candidate of the 2026-09-07 decision, bornes 0-3 whole); an
anti-robot challenge is not defeated; a `Crawl-delay` that was read applies;
a 429 on a PAGE stops the fetch. **The 429 on the rules file says nothing
about the 429 on the listing, and it is the latter that counts.** And «an
INDETERMINATE is not probed» no longer holds for the rules file: a guard that
could read nothing answers `allowed: True, certain: False`, and the
transport decides next.

**The pilot's opinion, given once and kept because it was given:** a 429 on
`/robots.txt` is a host that just said «slow down», and opening it sends a
request back within the second. The conduct that honours that without
contradicting the decision: **on a 429 (or a timeout) of the rules file the
first transport request waits `Retry-After` when the host gives one, else
10 s** — `first_request_delay` on the verdict, a delay and not a refusal.

**401 WAS THE FIRST CODE BROUGHT BACK TO THE LETTER — owner's decision of
2026-09-09, #201, applied 2026-09-11.** `api.ashbyhq.com` is the case: an
API gateway that demands a token on every path and makes no exception for
`/robots.txt`. It keeps its own state, `unauthenticated`, and the same open
door with `certain: False`.

**The price of the old departure was measured the day it shipped, and it is
now the general case.** Two Chilean government portals, the same
CloudFront-over-S3 static hosting, neither publishing a robots.txt:

    www.trabajaenelestado.cl/robots.txt   403, 111 bytes of S3 `AccessDenied`
    www.practicasparachile.cl/robots.txt  200, 16 kB of the site's own SPA

**Same absence, opposite verdicts** under the old rule — decided by whether
the distribution had a custom error page. On object storage a 403 is
routinely what a *missing key* returns. `_storage_note` still names the
shape for a person; the verdict no longer depends on it.

    That cost twice in one day. `crawl_delay` was missing, so
    `allowed(...).get("crawl_delay")` said *this host asked for nothing* about
    a host asking for ten seconds. Then `group_conflict` was found missing one
    key further along — and that one is worse, because it reports **whether the
    verdict itself is reliable**: a caller saw a clean boolean and never
    learned that two records contradict each other about us.

    **Filling the list case by case repairs instances and leaves the form.**
    The next field added to `verdict()` and forgotten here would fail exactly
    the same way, in silence, in the direction that costs — and a hand-kept
    list is precisely what this defect has already walked through once.

    So absence is loud. A key this mapping knows `verdict()` builds, and does
    not carry, raises on both `[...]` and `.get(...)`. A key nobody knows stays
    an ordinary miss: `.get()` returns its default, because inventing an error
    for an unknown name would break every caller probing for optional keys.

    Returns a dict with **`sweep`, which is `True`, `False` or `None`**,
    `reason`, and the raw signals. `None` means the rules could not be read —
    see the module header and #118. It is falsy, so a caller that never heard
    of the third state still fails closed.

    Conservative in one direction only: a blanket `Disallow: /` for the group
    that binds us, a `Content-Signal` saying `ai-input=no`, or **a host that
    answered 403 to its own rules file**, returns `sweep: False`. An **absent**
    file still returns True with the reason named — that is the one silence
    that really is permission, and this module must not invent a refusal from
    a 404.

    **That claim used to be false in the one place it mattered.** The
    `Content-Signal` was read with `re.search`, which stops at the first
    occurrence — so on a file carrying two, a refusal in the second was never
    seen and the module returned `sweep: True`. **The error went towards
    permitted, on the only signal here that expresses a refusal of consent.**
    Every occurrence is read now, restrictions are unioned, and a file that
    contradicts itself says so in `content_signal_conflict` instead of being
    summarised by whichever line the CDN happened to inject first. Issue #98.

    `host` is the host that **answered**; `requested_host` is what the caller
    asked for. They differ whenever a redirect crossed hosts, and the file
    read is the answering host's — see the cache note below. Issue #99.

    # `urllib` follows redirects across hosts, so `verdict("ss.ge")` from one
    # caller and from another aiming at a path that lands on `jobs.ss.ge`
    # would share one entry — and those two hosts publish different files.
    # `_ALIAS` remembers what a spelling resolved to, so a repeat costs
    # nothing. **A spelling never seen before still costs one request**: there
    # is no way to learn a redirect without following it, and this fixes the

    """Which of our two tokens may fetch `path`, or none — decided per token.

    **The owner's decision of 2026-09-05 replaces the restrictive reading.**
    Until then this module unioned the refusals of every record naming us: a
    host that opened `Claude-User` and closed `ClaudeBot` was reported closed,
    and the arbitration was left to a person. It is now made here:

    | the rules say | what this returns |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | `ClaudeBot` **or** `Claude-User` permitted | that token — ordinary HTTP |
    | both refused | `None` — the caller drives the browser |

    **This chooses; it does not retry.** `shared/robots-policy.md` forbids
    rotating agents *after* a refusal, and that stands: the identity is
    settled from the rules before any request for content is made, and a
    refusal received under the chosen token is a refusal, not an invitation to
    try the other one.

    Returns a dict: `token`, `state` (`"http"`, `"browser"`, `"closed"` or
    `"unknown"`), `per_token` with each token's own verdict, and `reason`.
    **`token` is `None` outside `http` and the caller must look at `state`**
    — a falsy token is not "unknown".

    **`browser` is the NAMED refusal of both tokens with `*` open — nothing
    else. #226, 2026-09-11.** `jobmada.com` publishes `User-agent: * /
    Disallow: /`, 26 bytes; both tokens are refused *by the group addressed
    to everybody*, and this function said `browser`. That is borne 1 of the
    2026-09-07 decision — *a refusal written in the rules blocks every
    route, the browser included* — and `verdict()` had it right («everything
    closed, evenly») while this path did not: the fourth disagreement
    between the module's decision paths, after the one #201 closed on HTTP
    codes. Now a refusal by `*` — or by any group that does not name the
    token it refuses — is `closed`, with the rule that decided; `browser`
    is reserved for the shape it was written for: a host that names both
    of us to refuse us and leaves everybody else in.

    **`certain` travels from the underlying verdicts.** When the rules could
    not be read, no token is permitted and the state is not `browser` either:
    an unknown is not a refusal, and `state` reads `"unknown"`.
