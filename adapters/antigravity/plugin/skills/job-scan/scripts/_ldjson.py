"""Read a page's `application/ld+json`, and say which half failed when it
does not work.

**Eighteen scripts here extract `ld+json`. Four passed `strict=False`. Two
boards need it.** Issue #76.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-09-02, ON 27 LIVE AD PAGES ACROSS NINE BOARDS:

    michaelpage.ch     0/3 parsed with a bare json.loads, 3/3 with strict=False
    a Chilean service  0/5 bare, 5/5 with strict=False
    adecco, crit, hays, infoempleo, randstad.fr    30/30 blocks parsed bare
    persigo, randstad.ch, sozialinfo               21/21 blocks parsed bare

So the deviation is **real and not universal**: two boards of ten need the
argument, and three of the four scripts that already pass it do not need it
today. That is the honest shape of it, and it is still worth doing everywhere:

**the flag costs nothing, and its absence costs the whole ad, silently.**
Every call site sits inside `try: … except: continue`, so an unparseable block
is skipped and the script goes on to report a board with no structured data.
Same asymmetry as `_robots.py`: between inventing a permission and inventing a
refusal, only one of the two errors announces itself.

THE OTHER DEVIATION IS NOT IN THE PARSER AT ALL, AND IT IS THE COMMONER ONE.

`randstadfr.py` documents a site that writes `<script type='application/ld+json'>`
with **single quotes**. Nothing reaches the parser: the extraction pattern
matches nothing, and the adapter reports `json_ld: false` on every ad — a total
failure wearing the face of "this board publishes no structured data".

**Ten of the eighteen patterns in this repository demand `type="` with double
quotes** (adecco, batiactu, digitalrecruiters, hellowork, icims, jobbkk,
jobology, meteojob, stepstone, taleez) and three of the tolerant eight lack
`re.I`. Each one is that same outage waiting for a board to change its
punctuation. **Quote style is not a contract. Match the attribute, not the
punctuation around it.**

AND THE THIRD FAILURE IS A SENTENCE. When a page contains "JobPosting" and no
block parsed, the fact is **a failure to read, here**. `crit.py` and
`randstadfr.py` say so; `hays.py` said only "contains 'JobPosting' but no
ld+json block parsed", which reads as the board's fault. `absent_reason()`
exists so the difference is a value, not a habit.

Usage:

    from _ldjson import postings, absent_reason

    jp = next(iter(postings(page)), None)
    if jp is None:
        reason = absent_reason(page)
        if reason.our_fault:
            die(f"{url}: {reason.text}")
        return {"json_ld": False, ...}
