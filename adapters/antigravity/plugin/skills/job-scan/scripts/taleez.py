"""Fetch job ads from a Taleez careers site — the French SME/ETI ATS.

Taleez is a Toulouse-built ATS used by French SMEs and mid-sized companies. Its
careers sites are the French counterpart of `umantis.md`: employers no
meta-board indexes, one tenant at a time, and **no tenant directory exists** —
the user supplies the careers URL.

Two endpoints, both unauthenticated and neither needing a browser:

  GET https://<tenant>.taleez.com/api/careez   → the whole careers site as JSON,
                                                  jobs included, in ONE request
  GET https://taleez.com/apply/<job slug>      → the ad, server-rendered, with a
                                                  JobPosting block

The listing carries no description, so `--with-detail` reads the ad page. It
also carries the tenant's own property referential, which is what turns opaque
ids into "Domaine métier: Commerce / Ventes" — see `decode_properties`.

Usage:
  taleez.py jobs --tenant bertintechnologies
  taleez.py jobs --url https://ufcv-emploi.taleez.com/ --with-detail
  taleez.py ad <job slug>

Output: one JSON object per line (jobs), or one JSON object (ad).
