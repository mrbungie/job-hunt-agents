"""Fetch Singapore ads from MyCareersFuture — the whole corpus, and none of
its text.

Singapore's national job portal, run by the **Skills and Workforce Development
Agency (SWDA)** — the renamed Workforce Singapore, which is why `wsg.gov.sg`
now lands on `swda.gov.sg`. Its public API needs **no key, no cookie, no
account and no browser**:

  GET  https://api.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/v2/jobs?limit=100&page=0
       → 200 JSON, {results[], total, countWithoutFilters, _links}
  GET  https://api.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/v2/jobs/<uuid>
       → 200 JSON, the same 29-key record, one ad
  https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/job/<uuid>
       → the ad, for a human; the slug is rebuilt client-side

**The whole corpus is reachable.** Page 967 returns 78 rows and page 968
returns 0, so 96 778 ads on 96 869 reported — there is no pagination ceiling
of the kind Indeed and JobStreet impose. Verified 2026-09-02.

THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THIS ADAPTER IS NOT TECHNICAL. SWDA's terms of use
(read 2026-09-02, last updated 27 Aug 2026) contain **no anti-automation
clause, no quota, no rate limit and no mention of the API** — reading is not
the problem. What they do say, twice, is:

    "All rights reserved. No part of any works on the Website may be
     reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or
     by any means … without written permission from SWDA."   (§15, §37)

    "Except as set forth below, caching and links to, and the framing of this
     website … is strictly prohibited."                      (§11, §33)

A pipeline ledger is a retrieval system, and it is a cache. **So this adapter
emits identifiers, URLs and the fields a match is scored on — never the text
of an ad.** `description` is read to measure it and dropped; the card carries
`description_chars` and nothing else. To read an ad, open its URL. Clause 16
provides for written permission to go further; asking for it is the user's
decision, not the plugin's.

THE SILENT NO-OP, AND THE LOUD ONE. The API is strict about **values** and
silent about **names**:

    ?categories=Not A Category      → 400, a real rejection
    ?employmentTypes=Full Time      → 200, 71 850 of 97 091 — the filter works
    ?employmentType=Full Time       → 200, 97 091 of 97 091 — SILENTLY IGNORED
    ?nonsense=zzz                   → 200, the whole corpus, no complaint

**A parameter name it does not know is accepted, ignored and answered 200**,
so the singular of a plural filter reads as a working search over the entire
board. A wrong *value* on a known name is a 400 you cannot miss; a wrong
*name* is a result set you will believe.

The response says so if you read it: **`total` equals `countWithoutFilters`
exactly when nothing filtered.** Every filtered call here compares the two and
says out loud when a filter did nothing, which is the only way to tell a
working filter from a typo.

`Re-open` IS A NORMAL STATUS. Of 40 ads drawn from the sitemap, 31 were
`Open` and **9 `Re-open`**, all 40 live. They are not rare and they are not
stale: the search is sorted newest-first, so `Re-open` rows sit deeper — page
0 was 100/100 `Open`, page 800 was 100/100 `Re-open`. **Code that keeps only
`status == "Open"` throws away a fifth of the board**, and a shallow sweep
never notices because it never reaches them.
