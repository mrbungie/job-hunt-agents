"""Fetch ads from a Personio careers site — the DACH ATS, one employer at a
time.

Personio is the applicant-tracking system most German, Austrian and **Swiss**
SMEs run their careers page on. Each tenant publishes a **documented XML feed**
of its open positions, with the full description, and it needs nothing:

  GET https://<tenant>.jobs.personio.de/xml     → every open position
  GET https://<tenant>.jobs.personio.com/xml    → the same bytes
  https://<tenant>.jobs.personio.de/job/<id>    → the ad, for a human

**No browser, no account, no key.** Unlike `arbeitsagentur.md` there is not
even a published key to send, and unlike the country boards there is no window:
one request returns the employer's whole board, descriptions included.

Verified against a live tenant on 2026-09-01.

THE TRAP THAT OUTLIVES THE BOARD: **`?language=` empties the ads without
emptying the board.**

    /xml                 7 positions, 7 with text, median 4 556 characters
    /xml?language=de     7 positions, 7 with text, median 4 556
    /xml?language=en     7 positions, 1 with text, median 0
    /xml?language=fr     7 positions, 0 with text, median 0

Same count, same ids, HTTP 200, valid XML — and on `fr` **not one of the seven
ads carries a word of its own description**. The parameter does not filter the
board or translate it; it serves whatever translation the employer happened to
enter, and returns the position with an empty body when there is none.

It is the worst shape this failure takes, because the request that triggers it
is a reasonable one: anybody asking for the language they read gets a
full-looking board of empty ads. So the adapter **reads the default feed**, and
when a language is requested it fetches both and refuses to report a language
whose text is missing — see `language_check`.

THE SECOND ONE IS ISSUE #55's, IN A NEW TAG. Every `<value>` in
`<jobDescriptions>` is wrapped in CDATA:

    <value><![CDATA[<span style="…">ottonova - wir sind …</span>]]></value>

A `<value>([^<]*)</value>` extractor returns nothing at all from a perfectly
valid feed. It is the same wrapper `hays-fr.md` found in `<loc>`, in a
different element, on a different vendor — which is the argument for the
tolerant pattern being the house default rather than a per-board fix.

THERE IS NO TENANT DIRECTORY. Like `umantis.md`, `taleez.md` and `flatchr.md`,
Personio publishes no cross-tenant search and its own marketing sitemap lists
no employer. **Ask the user for the careers URL and never guess a tenant** — a
wrong one answers a Next.js 404 page, not an error.

*(`robots.txt` on a tenant host is a 404: none is published, so nothing is
disallowed. The marketing host `www.personio.de` answered **429 on every
attempt**, so its own robots.txt could not be read — that is not established,
and it is recorded as not established rather than assumed either way. The
adapter reads only tenant hosts.)*

Usage:
  personio.py jobs --tenant ottonova
  personio.py jobs --tenant ottonova --language en
  personio.py check --tenant ottonova

Output: one JSON object per line.
