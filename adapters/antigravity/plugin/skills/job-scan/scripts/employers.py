"""What is true of an *employer*, read before an ad of theirs is proposed.

**Issue #94.** The ledger is indexed by advertisement, so a decision about a
company written on one ad's row is found only by luck.

WHAT IT COST, MEASURED 2026-09-02:

    19.08  freeze on an employer declared      → written on one ad's row
    27.08  freeze lifted by the candidate      → written on another ad's row
    02.09  a scan discards three of that
           employer's ads, citing "the freeze
           of 2026-08-19, a standing decision"

**Two live ads were discarded on a decision that no longer existed.** The two
notes sat eighteen rows apart. `SKILL.md` says to read a row's notes before
proposing it, **and that was done — one note was read.** The fact that
cancelled it lived elsewhere, and nothing in the file's structure said to go
and look.

**SO THIS COMMAND EXISTS TO MAKE THE LOOKUP MECHANICAL RATHER THAN HOPED FOR.**
`lookup` returns every standing decision for an employer **with its lifting
date beside it**, so a lifted freeze cannot be read as a live one. A reader who
has to join two facts across eighteen rows will eventually not.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It never reads the ledger and never reports a score, a
status or an ad. **Two places that say the same thing eventually disagree** —
a wrong percentage in this repository once survived two clean-ups because it
was written in three places. The authority rule is written in
`shared/workspace.md`: **the ledger is authoritative about advertisements, this
file about the employer, and they never speak about the same thing.**
