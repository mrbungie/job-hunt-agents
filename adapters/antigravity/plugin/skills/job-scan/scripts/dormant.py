"""Which dormant boards are due for a yield re-check?

A board goes **dormant** when a real run showed it carries nothing for this
candidate — not when it broke, and not when the user never wanted it. The
difference matters: a board that is merely off should never be mentioned again,
while a dormant one is a bet that could come good. `jobs.bobst.com` is the case
that produced this file: BOBST is 25 minutes from the candidate and runs on an
adapter that works, and on 2026-08-30 its ten open vacancies were *all*
apprenticeships. Wrong month, not wrong board.

Dormancy is four flat keys under `boards.<name>` in the user's `config.yml`,
alongside `enabled: false`:

    boards:
      umantis:
        enabled: false
        dormant_since: "2026-08-30"
        dormant_reason: "10 vacances, toutes des apprentissages et des stages"
        recheck_after: "2026-11-30"
        recheck_count: 0

**`enabled: false` with no `dormant_since` is a hard off.** It is never probed,
never reported and never proposed — that state predates this file and keeps its
meaning exactly. Dormancy is opt-in, and only the user (or a run that measured
a zero) may write it.

    dormant.py list  --config <path>          # every dormant board, due or not
    dormant.py due   --config <path>          # only those whose date has passed
    dormant.py next  --count <n>              # the next re-check date to write

Output: one JSON object per line, or nothing at all when nothing is due —
which is the common case and is not an error.

**Every failure here is loud.** A config this cannot parse exits non-zero and
says which line defeated it, because the silent failure available to a tool
like this one is to report "nothing due" for a file it never understood, and
that reads exactly like a healthy workspace.
