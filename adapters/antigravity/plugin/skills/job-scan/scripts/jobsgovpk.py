"""Fetch Pakistan's national vacancies from NEXT — the whole board in one
request, and **it tells you how much of it is dead.**

`jobs.gov.pk` is Pakistan's national employment exchange. **No key, no cookie,
no browser, no endpoint** — one GET returns every advertisement it holds, and
the page states its own totals in the markup.

  GET /JobSeeker/SearchJobs?keyword=            → 1 511 advertisements, ~3.5 MB
  GET /JobSeeker/ViewJobDetails/<id>?orgId=&jobId=  → one advertisement

**1 506 OF 1 511 ARE EXPIRED. FIVE ARE LIVE.** Measured 2026-09-03, and the
board says so itself: the listing header prints `1511 total` and `1506
expired`, and every card carries `portal-job-card--live` or
`portal-job-card--expired`.

**Those are two independent measurements, this script compares them, and on
this board they disagree.** Measured 2026-09-03:

    /JobSeeker/JobSeekerJobs   header: 1511 total, 1506 expired
    /JobSeeker/SearchJobs      header:    5 total, 1506 expired
                               markup:  1511 cards, 1506 marked expired

**The same counter label carries different numbers on two pages, and on the
search page it contradicts the page's own cards** — 5 total beside 1 506
expired is not arithmetic. The browse page is the coherent one: 1 506 + 5 =
1 511, and that matches the rendered cards exactly.

**This script counts the cards and reports the header beside them**, saying
plainly when they differ rather than choosing. A total quoted from a header
nobody checked is how this repository has been wrong before.

**So `--live` is the flag that matters, and it is not the default.** Returning
1 511 rows without saying that 99.7% of them closed would be a count that is
accurate and useless. Both numbers are printed on every run.

READ FIELDS BY CLASS, NEVER BY POSITION. `portal-job-card__title`,
`portal-job-card__org`, `portal-badge--type`, and the labelled facts
(`Deadline`, `Location`, `Vacancies`, `Salary`, `Scale`). Fill rates on the
1 511, counted on values:

    Deadline    1 511 / 1 511
    Location    1 511 / 1 511
    Vacancies   1 511 / 1 511
    Salary      1 428 / 1 511   (94.5%)
    Scale          83 / 1 511   (5.5%)

**SOME CARDS LINK TO A LOGIN AND THE ADVERTISEMENT IS STILL PUBLIC.** The five
live ones offer *"Sign in to apply"* beside *"View details"*, and the sign-in
link is the **apply** route. The detail page itself answers 200 with no wall —
the site's own words are *"Login is required only to apply."* This script
reads the public detail URL and **never touches the login route**; the card
carries `apply_needs_sign_in` so the fact is in the row rather than in
somebody's memory.

`robots.txt` on `jobs.gov.pk` is not a rules file — the host serves markup for
it — so **no rules were read and none were invented**. `www.jobs.gov.pk` does
not resolve at all.

Verified against the live site on **2026-09-03**.
