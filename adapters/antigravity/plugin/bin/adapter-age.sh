# claude-job-hunt — which adapters are due for re-verification.
#
# THE FIELD IS A CONTRACT; A DATE IN THE PROSE IS A GUESS. This script used to
# read every date it could find in a file and take the oldest as a verification
# date. On 2026-09-02 it reported jobbkk as 1 384 days stale, because
# jobbkk.md quotes `created_at: 2022-11-17` — a date this repository MEASURED
# on a live ad, to document a board that refreshes ancient postings.
#
# That is issue #67 turned on our own tooling: a value that is present, well
# formed, and does not mean what the reader thinks. Five board files had
# documented that pattern before it caught the tool that looks for it.
# **A script that reads "any date" has no field — it has a heuristic.**
#
# So the source of truth is one explicit header line, near the top of a file:
#
#     <!-- verified: 2026-09-02 -->
#
# A file without one is reported UNDECLARED, not due: the absence of a header
# is not an age, and guessing is what caused this. The migration is
# incremental — every file touched by ordinary work gains the line — with the
# good side effect that recording a verification becomes deliberate rather
# than a by-product of having quoted a date somewhere.
#
# This reads those headers back and sorts by the oldest:
#
#   bin/adapter-age.sh [days]      # default 30
#
# It changes nothing and always exits 0: it is a report, not a gate. A stale
# adapter is not a broken one — it is one nobody has re-run. The only way to
# find out is to run it, which is what the report is for.
set -uo pipefail   # deliberately NOT -e: a file with no date is a result
