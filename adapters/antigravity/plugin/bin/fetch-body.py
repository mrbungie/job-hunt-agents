"""Fetch one URL and write the body **with its provenance**. — #158

    bin/fetch-body.py https://host.example/robots.txt -o scratch/h.txt
    bin/fetch-body.py https://host.example/sitemap.xml -o s.xml --allow-refusal

**Use this instead of an ad-hoc script.** That is the whole point: the bodies
lost on 2026-09-05 were not written by any adapter — *no adapter in this
repository writes a fetched body to disk at all* — they were written by
one-off scripts in a scratchpad, and every one of them is now unattributable.
An audit of one session's scratchpad the same day: **365 bodies, 0 with
provenance.**

WHAT THIS DOES THAT AN AD-HOC SCRIPT KEEPS FORGETTING

**1. It asks the guard on the exact URL, host included.** Not the root. A
sitemap can live on a host the guard has never seen — `merojob.com` declares
its own on `sg.merojob.com` — and a path declared somewhere other than
`/sitemap.xml` is covered by no verdict taken at the root.

**2. It declares this project's identity.** `_ua.UA`, never a browser string.
A tool's identity appears nowhere in its output, so it is verified rather than
observed — and one draft script sent Chrome for a whole day while the module
beside it declared itself properly.

**3. It tests the HTTP code, and records it either way.** A readable body is
not an answer: a 403 page once entered a fingerprint table as *"5 587 bytes of
robots.txt"*, md5 included, and that false success then invented a cause for
itself that took four measurements to demolish. Here a non-200 is written
**with its status in the record** and reported on stderr; nothing is silently
promoted to a success.

**4. It honours `Crawl-delay` when the host sets one.** `ejob.az` names
`ClaudeBot` to give it `Crawl-delay: 5` and forbids it nothing — named,
allowed, conditioned.

WHAT IT REFUSES

A path the rules refuse is **not fetched**, and there is no flag for that.
`--allow-refusal` is about the *HTTP* status: it lets a 4xx/5xx body be saved
for study, which is legitimate and was never the problem — the problem was
calling it a success.

#     2  the TRANSPORT refuses a path the rules PERMIT
#
# **The third was the one with no code of its own**, and it now takes `2`
# rather than `7`. Answering `7` there would say *the host wrote a refusal*
# about a host whose file grants the path — collapsing the distinction that

    **A record of compressed bytes describes the transfer, not the document.**
    `apec.fr` answers gzip without being asked: 14 171 bytes on the wire for a
    65 551-byte page. Two things follow, and the second is the heavy one.

    A `grep` over such a body returns **no match and no error** — a negative
    manufactured by an encoding, and one was published as *"apec serves no
    total"* before it was caught.

    And an md5 taken there compares transfers. **Two identical responses
    compressed differently give different `bytes` and different `md5` for the
    same document** — a third road to the false *"the file changed"*, after
    this morning's stripped trailing newline and a render stamp.

    So the record describes the decoded body, and **names the encoding it
    undid** rather than silently erasing it: `encoded_bytes` keeps what came
    off the wire, because a transfer size is a real fact about a host and the
    point is to stop the two being one number.
