"""Run a mutation sweep **on a copy**, never in the shared tree. — #167

    bin/mutation-bench.py mutations.json --out results.jsonl

WHY IT DOES NOT RUN WHERE YOU ARE

On 2026-09-05 a sweep ran in the shared working tree. Two other sessions were
working in it. Two things went wrong and only the second was foreseen:

  * a mutation was live for **eight minutes** because the first run was killed
    at a timeout and its `finally` never executed. **A `finally` does not
    survive the death of its process**, and the announcement that "each
    mutation restores itself" promised a guarantee the mechanism does not give;
  * the second run then started from that dirty tree **believing it was
    clean**, because nothing checked.

One session spent a quarter of an hour dismantling its own conclusions against
file mtimes to work out which of its measurements had been taken under a
mutation. **The result of the sweep was worth less than that.**

So: a throwaway `git worktree`, and the shared tree is never written to.

THREE THINGS THE DAY TAUGHT, BUILT IN

**Cleanliness is checked, not promised** — at the start, because the second run
began dirty, and at the end, because a bench that leaves residue has failed
even if every mutation reported correctly. A dirty tree at either end is a
failure *of the bench*.

**Results are written and flushed after every mutation.** The sweep that died
lost all twenty-four, and four survived only because a human remembered them.

**And every mutation is classified.** *A silent mutation moves a **threshold**
without changing a **form**.* The bench knows which it made, because it knows
what it substituted: a numeric constant, or an element dropped from a tuple, is
silent; an `if False:` is not.

WHY THE CLASSIFICATION IS THE POINT

`FETCH_TOKENS` with `claude-user` removed **breaks nothing**. The code reads
the real file, extracts the real `Crawl-delay`, and returns a fully
circumstantial refusal — no exception, no absurd value, **a plausible and
specific verdict that is wrong in a known direction**. A measurement taken
under it would have revived a thesis refuted the day before, with output more
detailed than the measurement that killed it.

So the number worth reading is not how many mutations went red. It is **the
share of silent mutations that went red, per file**. A file where they go red
is guarded on its values. A file where they pass is guarded on its shapes —
and `_robots.py`, whose guard would not have noticed `FETCH_TOKENS`
amputated, is the specimen.
